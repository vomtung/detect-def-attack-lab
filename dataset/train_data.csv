A step closer to repeaters for quantum networks 
Loss of photons over long-distance connections limits the development of quantum networks, necessitating the use of quantum repeater systems to boost signals between network nodes. Erbium ions incorporated into calcium tungstate crystals have been found to emit photons in the telecommunications frequency band that are indistinguishable from each other, and thus show promise for use in such repeaters.

Observation of  28 O and  27 O through their decay into  24 O and four and three neutrons, respectively, is reported, with the  28 O nucleus being of particular interest owing to proton and neutron magic numbers and its extremely asymmetric neutron-to-proton ratio.

Features 
File compression.
File size is automatically optimized when you upload to
Shopify. The change in file quality isnt noticeable to the
human eye, but itll improve page load time.
File format conversion.
Shopify automatically detects which file formats are supported
on the client side and sends the best option. Example:
Converts images to WebP or AVIF where supported, but JPG as a fallback
for other clients.
Dynamic editing.
Unlike destructive editing, dynamic editing allows you to crop
and transform your image without losing the original file.
Simply indicate the desired state using URL parameters. These
parameters will be interpreted and used to on-the-fly
transform the file. The original file remains preserved and
untouched.
All in real time.
The compression, file format conversion, and dynamic editing
all happen in real time. Users have negligible to no wait time
as our servers around the world ensure ultra fast delivery.

Juan Zacarias  Game Product Manager, Motive Studios EA                       Bitly is user-friendly and accessible. Its the one-stop-shop for all link-associated things.       Jashima W.

It cuts my time down because it saves all my information, and it gives me insight into which links are most popular and have the most clicks.       Mary H.

Bitly also gives us data analytics on who is clicking our links which helps us carry the clients forward in the advertising process.       Thankdeka M.  Project Manager                                 Loved by big and small brands everywhere                           Frequently asked questions               What is a URL shortener?       A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like a simple tool, but it is a service that can have a dramatic impact on your marketing efforts.   Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL into a shorter, more readable link. When a user clicks the shortened version, theyre automatically forwarded to the destination URL.   Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address. You can, for example, use a short URL like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good idea about where your link will lead before they click it.   If youre contributing content to the online world, you  need  a URL shortener.   Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener above.           Benefits of a short URL       How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if it has tons of characters and symbols? A short URL can make your link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to easily recall and share your link with others, it can also dramatically improve traffic to your content.   On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to incorporate into your collateral  whether youre looking to engage with your customers offline or online.   Bitly is the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to small brands to large enterprises, who are looking for a simple way to create, track and manage their links.   Find a plan that works for you           What is a custom URL shortener?       A custom URL shortener, sometimes referred to as a branded URL shortener, lets you brand your links.   For example, instead of bit.ly/2m75BWD, you could use a custom short URL like yourbrnd.co/2m75BWD.   There are several benefits of branding your short links. Branded links build trust between your audience and your business, drive more clicks, give your audience a preview of where they are being taken and increase brand awareness.   A link shortening service that includes custom short URLs is vital to improving audience engagement with your communications. A short URL is good, but a custom URL works every time.           What is a QR Code?       Quick response or QR, is a type of barcode that can store a multitude of information. The obvious difference between a QR Code and Barcode is its appearance. A QR Code is usually in the shape of a square and contains smaller, even blocks similar to Tetris. A Barcode, on the other hand, has vertical bars in different thicknesses and is often accompanied by a serial number.           What can a QR Code do?       Because of its versatility, a QR Code can be programmed to do a multitude of things. It can be split into two formats: Dynamic and Static. A Dynamic QR Code is useful for businesses or nonprofits in their marketing strategy because of its advantages. Though it needs a subscription to work, it is a small price to pay compared to the benefits it offers. Dynamic QR Code solutions are editable, which means if you made a mistake and only noticed it after the QR Codes are printed, you can easily log in to the dashboard and fix them without changing the appearance of the already printed Codes.           What is a Link-in-bio?       The term Link-in-bio refers to the clickable URL that you can add to your profile section for social media. Most social media platforms give you the option to add a link in your bio to take followers to your website, product page, content or some other important page.           Why choose Bitly?

"EepURL - A Mailchimp Service 
Visit Mailchimp  
EepURL 
We created EepURL as a trackable shortening service for Mailchimp's
built-in  Twitter integration . At the time, we
opened it up to the public, because we felt there weren't enough
monkey-based URL shorteners out there. 
This service is no longer available for  public  use. We made
this change in order to protect the reputation of the domain and high
deliverability rates for Mailchimp customers who use EepURLs in their
campaigns. 
Existing URLs are still being redirected, and EepURL still works in
the app. 
If you're looking to build your own url shortener, take a moment to
look at  Shaun Inman's Lessn . Building your own url
shortener is a good way to avoid having your links connected to a
blocklisted domain name.",0

A URL shortener, also referred to as a link shortener, may appear straightforward, but its use can significantly boost your marketing strategy. Link shorteners function by converting lengthy URLs into more compact, comprehensible versions. Clicking the abbreviated link redirects the user seamlessly to the intended destination URL. Consider a shortened URL as a catchy and concise moniker for your extended webpage address. For instance, you could use a short URL such as  rb.gy/mynewbook , offering a clear preview of what to expect when the link is clicked. For individuals creating and sharing content online, a URL shortener is a valuable asset. Elevate your URLs with our user-friendly, complimentary link shortener provided above. What is a custom URL shortener? A custom URL shortener is a URL shortening service such as Rebrandly that allows you to personalize the shortened links into branded links.. Instead of a randomly generated alphanumeric code, you can specify a word or phrase to be included in the URL. This also enables you to turn your custom domain into a branded domain with a shortened URL. This can enhance brand visibility and recall, as well as increase trust in the link since the custom part can provide some context about where the link leads. How do I shorten a URL for free? To shorten a URL for free, you can use online services such as Rebrandly on all your links. The process is simple: you use Rebrandly's URL shortener generator, paste the long URL into the designated field, and then click a button to generate the shortened URL. How do I change a long URL to a short URL? Changing a long URL to a short one involves using a URL shortening service such as Rebrandly. You first copy the long URL that you wish to shorten. Then, use the URL shortener generator. You will find a field where you can paste the long URL. After pasting the URL, click on the button ""Shorten URL."" Rebrandly will then provide you with a shortened version of your original URL, which redirects to the same page when clicked. Which link shortener is best? Rebrandly is one of the most popular and best URL shorteners due to its reliability and additional personalization, security, and management features. It not only provides a short URL but also allows users to track the URL's performance through click-through rates and branded URLs.

First, they are more manageable and look cleaner, especially in contexts with character restrictions such as social media posts. This matters because cleaner URLs are more appealing to the user, and that translates to a higher conversion or click through rate. They are also easier to remember and type manually, if necessary. Second, many URL shorteners offer tracking capabilities, providing valuable analytics on how many times a link has been clicked, which can offer important insights for businesses or marketing campaigns. Lastly, short URLs can be customized, improving brand visibility and making the links more trustworthy to potential clickers. Can I change my subscription at any time? Yes.

Quotes 
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.

Now in my fourth year with A2, fortunately it is quite a long time since I needed any support with my sites. However, when I did that support was provided quickly and effectively. The continued benefit provided by the suite of plugins in A2 optimized is especially useful on my WordPress sites.

The A2 support is really great, some of the best support people Ive ever encountered. They did not fix the issue though and told me to sign up for the WordPress forum which Im not doing. Outside that, the A2 service as a whole is really great.

I had a peculiar, unusual problem with my WordPress installation. I submitted my ticket to Support and had, not only a reply, but a fix within the hour and this was at the beginning of the weekend on Friday night! EXCELLENT SERVICE. Five Stars all the way. Thank you.  George

A2 has been a great host for numerous WordPress sites that have Turbo Boost servers, as well as a reseller sever for our smaller clients. The servers are fast, the software abilities inside the server are wonderful and their phone support is fantastic.

The Migration worked exceedingly well. Not only were my files migrated, but my databases were loaded too. So WordPress and some personal stuff worked.

wrote Using Friction As A Feature In Machine Learning Algorithms Friction often has a negative connotation in user experience design, but it actually has many benefits. Its best-known use case is mitigating unintended consequences in high-risk scenarios, yet it has a new place in the age of artificial intelligence.

Crowdrise + GoFundMe 
Crowdrise is now part of GoFundMe, the largest and most trusted fundraising online platform. 
Start a GoFundMe 
CrowdRise was co-founded by the actor Edward Norton, producer Shauna Robertson, and Robert and Jeffrey Wolfe in 2009 while trying to raise money for the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust. They created a bespoke platform to do so, and realized that it could be used by others, too. 
Our entire team at CrowdRise is incredibly excited to be a part of the GoFundMe revolution because we authentically share their vision, said Robert Wolfe, CEO of CrowdRise, in a statement. We really believe that this combination is going to comprehensively rewrite the way the people take care of each other and act on their desires to make the world a better place. The scale of what we can do together is truly awesome.

"TradeTrust - An easy way to check and verify your documents
A Trust Network for Trading Partners
A digital utility that comprises a set of globally-accepted standards and frameworks that connects governments and businesses to a public blockchain to enable trusted interoperability and exchanges of electronic trade documents across digital platforms.
Main Benefits
TradeTrust can bring benefits to the trade, finance and logistics community:
Legal certainty for electronic Transferable Documents
Singapore’s  Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) amendments enable the creation and use of electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs) that are legally equivalent to paper-based Bills of Lading.
Increase efficiency, lower cost and lower risk of fraud
Risk of fraud is mitigated through the use of DLT technology to verify the authenticity and provenance of the trade documents.
US$4 billion savings annually if half of today’s shipping lines adopt eBLs – according to the Digital Container Shipping Association (DSCA).
Support innovative service offerings
Aid the convergence of physical, financial and document chains making automation of key processes possible.",0

At the time, no single team member knew Go, but
within a month, everyone was writing in Go  and we were
building out the endpoints. It was the flexibility, how easy it was to use,
and the really cool concept behind Go (how Go handles native concurrency,
garbage collection, and of course safety+speed.) that helped engage us
during the build. Also, who can beat that cute mascot! 
Jaime Enrique Garcia Lopez,
Senior Software Development Manager 
at Capital One 
"" A small language that compiles fast makes for a happy developer. 
The Go language is small, compiles really fast, and as a result it lets your
mind focus on the actual problem and less on the tool you are using to solve
it. Code, test, debug cycles are so quick that you forget you are not
working with an interpreted language. Looking at our code, you see
less boilerplate and more business logic. "" 
Clayton Coleman,
Lead Engineer, Open Shift 
at RedHat 
Go has excellent characteristics for scalability and services
written using it typically have very small memory footprints. 
Because code is compiled into a single static binary, services can also be
containerised with ease, making it much simpler to build and deploy. These
attributes make  Go an ideal choice for companies building
microservices , as you can easily deploy into a highly available and
scalable environment such as Kubernetes. 
Matt Boyle,
Lead Software Engineer 
at Curve 
""In our tightly managed environments where we run Go code,
we have seen a CPU reduction of approximately 10% 
with cleaner and maintainable code."" 
Bala Natarajan,
Sr. Director of Engineering, Developer Experience 
at PayPal 
""Tooling has always been a problem with our legacy code base... but we have
found that Go has excellent tooling, plus built-in testing, benchmarking,
and profiling frameworks. It is easy to write efficient and resilient
applications.  After working on Go, most of our developers don't want
to go back to other languages. "" 
Benjamin Cane,
Vice President and Principal Engineer 
at American Express 
""...when a programming language is designed for exactly the environment most
of us use right nowscalable, cloud-based servers that are optimized for
performancea lot can go right.""

What Spreaker podcasters have to say 
Meet the podcasters making a living on Spreaker 
Josh Hallmark, host of
True Crime Bullsh** 
Thank you, so much, for making podcasting a viable career for me. I was struggling before Spreaker came into my life. And now I can do this full time, without worrying about money. You folks really have changed my life for the better!
Ahyiana Angel, host of
Switch, Pivot or Quit 
The Spreaker platform has introduced me to opportunities to amplify my voice as a podcaster, they have highlighted my efforts in many ways and I'm grateful for the work that they do. Monetizing through Spreaker has allowed me to realize revenue through my podcast that it would have been challenging to accomplish on my own.
Emily G Thompson, host of
Morbidology 
Thanks to Spreaker I have been able to monetize my podcast and work as a full-time podcaster. Spreaker Prime takes the stress out of worrying about how to monetize your podcast and begin to make money for 
your hard work. The team is always on hand to answer any queries or assist in any way possible, making for a seamless partnership.

It cuts my time down because it saves all my information, and it gives me insight into which links are most popular and have the most clicks.       Mary H.

Bitly also gives us data analytics on who is clicking our links which helps us carry the clients forward in the advertising process.       Thankdeka M.  Project Manager                                 Loved by big and small brands everywhere                           Frequently asked questions               What is a URL shortener?       A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like a simple tool, but it is a service that can have a dramatic impact on your marketing efforts.   Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL into a shorter, more readable link. When a user clicks the shortened version, theyre automatically forwarded to the destination URL.   Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address. You can, for example, use a short URL like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good idea about where your link will lead before they click it.   If youre contributing content to the online world, you  need  a URL shortener.   Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener above.           Benefits of a short URL       How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if it has tons of characters and symbols? A short URL can make your link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to easily recall and share your link with others, it can also dramatically improve traffic to your content.   On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to incorporate into your collateral  whether youre looking to engage with your customers offline or online.   Bitly is the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to small brands to large enterprises, who are looking for a simple way to create, track and manage their links.   Find a plan that works for you           What is a custom URL shortener?       A custom URL shortener, sometimes referred to as a branded URL shortener, lets you brand your links.   For example, instead of bit.ly/2m75BWD, you could use a custom short URL like yourbrnd.co/2m75BWD.   There are several benefits of branding your short links. Branded links build trust between your audience and your business, drive more clicks, give your audience a preview of where they are being taken and increase brand awareness.   A link shortening service that includes custom short URLs is vital to improving audience engagement with your communications. A short URL is good, but a custom URL works every time.           What is a QR Code?       Quick response or QR, is a type of barcode that can store a multitude of information. The obvious difference between a QR Code and Barcode is its appearance. A QR Code is usually in the shape of a square and contains smaller, even blocks similar to Tetris. A Barcode, on the other hand, has vertical bars in different thicknesses and is often accompanied by a serial number.           What can a QR Code do?       Because of its versatility, a QR Code can be programmed to do a multitude of things. It can be split into two formats: Dynamic and Static. A Dynamic QR Code is useful for businesses or nonprofits in their marketing strategy because of its advantages. Though it needs a subscription to work, it is a small price to pay compared to the benefits it offers. Dynamic QR Code solutions are editable, which means if you made a mistake and only noticed it after the QR Codes are printed, you can easily log in to the dashboard and fix them without changing the appearance of the already printed Codes.           What is a Link-in-bio?       The term Link-in-bio refers to the clickable URL that you can add to your profile section for social media. Most social media platforms give you the option to add a link in your bio to take followers to your website, product page, content or some other important page.           Why choose Bitly?       Whether youre sharing one link or scan or millions, our platform was built to help you make every point of connection between your content and your audience ignite action.   Its why the most recognized brands in the world love our platform.

Making the Film: The Basement 
Tagged  video ,  processes  and  short film 
So I have begun working on my next set of short films, and I thought that this time I would document the process, as well as  have a process . The  first 3  that I put together were very much seat of my pants, in the moment kind of deals, and while that was fun and all, I wanted to take a stab at doing something different with this go round. As it says on the tin, this first film will be focused on a location, namely a basement, specifically my basement. It's hella  spooky . The first step of my new process is location scouting, since I already have the story pinned down (more on that at a later date!). Since I already had the location secured, I needed to get a feel for what the space could offer, and start to discover the mood and tone of the film. Since I have the most severe form of  Aphantasia , this turned out to be more critical than I was anticipating. For those who are unfamiliar with this condition, which is most people I find, it means I don't have a minds eye or inner voice. I can't see or hear anything in my head. It's just a yawning black void. As you can imagine it makes things like filmmaking, art and writing particularly difficult. All things I am gifted at or enjoy doing. The universe seems to have a sense of humor. So I hit the basement with my trusty FujiFilm XE-3 and took some photos that felt right when thinking of the mood and feeling I want to evoke with this particular work. I thought I would share the photos here so you can see how my brain works and what I hope to create with this film. I have color graded them to be more inline with what I want. Here are the ""location scout photos"" in no particular order.

Il  plebiscito sullo scioglimento del Landtag prussiano  (o  Dieta  prussiana) fu una consultazione popolare che si tenne in  Prussia , Stato federato della  Repubblica di Weimar , il 9 agosto 1931. Il plebiscito fu indetto a seguito di una petizione popolare, presentata dall'organizzazione di destra antirepubblicana  Stahlhelm , al fine di ottenere lo scioglimento anticipato dell' assemblea legislativa della Prussia  e provocare, di conseguenza, la caduta del governo prussiano guidato dal  socialdemocratico   Otto Braun . Il plebiscito fall a causa del mancato raggiungimento del  quorum  del 50% degli elettori, essendosi recato alle urne solo il 39,21% di essi.
Nonostante si trattasse di un'iniziativa delle forze politiche di destra, tra cui il  Partito Nazionalsocialista Tedesco dei Lavoratori  (NSDAP) di  Adolf Hitler , l' Internazionale Comunista  controllata da  Iosif Stalin  schier il  Partito Comunista di Germania  (KPD) a sostegno del plebiscito. In virt della teoria del  socialfascismo , i comunisti consideravano i socialdemocratici alla stessa stregua dei partiti di destra, cosicch aderirono al plebiscito con l'obiettivo di accelerare il crollo del sistema capitalista, che giudicavano vicino. Nella campagna propagandistica comunista la consultazione popolare fu ribattezzata "" plebiscito rosso "" ( roter Volksentscheid ). In riferimento alla particolare composizione della coalizione plebiscitaria, l'evento  talvolta ricordato anche come "" plebiscito rossobruno "" ( rot-brauner Volksentscheid ). La linea di sostegno al plebiscito seguita dall'Internazionale Comunista fu duramente criticata da  Lev Trockij  e da varie organizzazioni comuniste dissidenti.
Il fallimento del plebiscito rappresent una temporanea battuta d'arresto per Hitler, ma la partecipazione dei comunisti acu il contrasto che li opponeva ai socialdemocratici, contribuendo alla mancata formazione di un efficace blocco antinazista e dunque al  successivo crollo  della Repubblica di Weimar.

La  Biblioteca Malatestiana  di  Cesena  fu fondata a met del  XV secolo  grazie agli sforzi congiunti del signore della citt,  Domenico Malatesta , e dei  frati francescani  del locale convento, che ospitarono nei propri edifici la raccolta di libri: questa  biblioteca   monastica  si differenzi dalle altre per essere stata impostata come istituzione civica, affidata cio alle cure degli organismi comunali. Prima del suo genere, crebbe per fama e importanza nel corso dell' et moderna  e raccolse diverse opere manoscritte, incatenate a una serie di  plutei  collocati nell'Aula del Nuti. Il suo patrimonio sopravvisse all'occupazione francese e alla trasformazione della biblioteca in caserma (1797-98) grazie agli sforzi della cittadinanza che riebbe in possesso il complesso conventuale qualche anno dopo: nel 1807 la Malatestiana fu ristabilita nel suo stato originale, da allora lasciato invariato. Infatti si svilupp una biblioteca comunale (detta Malatestiana nuova) che, nel corso del  XIX secolo , fu via via ampliata negli spazi e nella raccolta, diventando un'istituzione aperta a tutti.
Sopravvissuta indenne alla  seconda guerra mondiale  e oggetto di restauri e valorizzazioni, nel 2005 l' UNESCO  riconobbe la grande importanza culturale e storica della Malatestiana antica, inserendola nel Registro della  Memoria del mondo . Tra vecchia e nuova biblioteca, la Malatesiana conserva quasi 380000 volumi, comprese migliaia di opere manoscritte di grande valore, quotidiani, riviste, fotografie, lettere e articoli di  numismatica .

Ep.K636: Concerns Mount for Japanese Eateries in China as Fukushima Water Discharge Looms
Just over three weeks have passed since China heightened its scrutiny of Japanese food imports due to radiation concerns, and Kazuyuki Tanioka, the owner of an upscale sushi restaurant in Beijing, is already grappling with fears about the future of his business. Tanioka's Toya, a renowned establishment that has endured the challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions, now faces a double blow  a decline in customers and a scarcity of seafood  in anticipation of Japan's decision to release treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. This impending crisis is causing serious concerns for Tanioka, who describes the situation as a potential life or death scenario.
COVID-19
China stands as the largest importer of Japanese seafood. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by the 2011 tsunami and earthquake, China initially banned food and agricultural product imports from five Japanese prefectures. This restriction was subsequently expanded to include ten prefectures out of Japan's total of 47. Despite these bans, Japan has consistently relied on China as its principal seafood export market. However, the recent surge in import restrictions followed the approval of Japan's plan by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog to discharge treated water from the Fukushima site. China, along with domestic opposition, strongly criticized this decision, citing potential threats to marine life and human health.
201147
The impact of these restrictions on imports has been substantial, with severe delays at customs and a notable decline in customers. Strident warnings circulating on Chinese social media platforms, asserting that Japanese food is radioactive and should be boycotted, have further deterred potential patrons. Kenji Kobayashi, a Japanese restaurant owner in Beijing, has seen a significant drop in his customer base this month, emphasizing the disparity between China's viewpoint of contaminated water and Japan's perspective of purified water as a key factor affecting public perception.
Beyond restaurants, seafood suppliers are also grappling with the consequences. Longer wait times at Chinese ports, now averaging around three weeks, have prompted some suppliers to consider diverting shipments to third countries to circumvent the restrictions. This, however, presents challenges and financial burdens. Japanese officials have appealed to their Chinese counterparts to avoid a complete ban, but amidst the tensions, some Chinese diners support the stricter checks for the sake of citizen safety. With the impending discharge of Fukushima water, Japanese restaurant owners are adapting their strategies, exploring alternative seafood sources within China or from foreign suppliers, in a bid to ensure the continuity of their businesses.

Some university scientists in the U.S. had apparently filed a patent for using turmeric to help heal wounds. Mashelkar was shocked, because he knew that using turmeric that way was a well known remedy in traditional Indian medicine. And he knew that patents are for brand new inventions. So, he decided to do something about it  to go to battle against the turmeric patent.
But as he would soon discover, turmeric wasn't the only piece of traditional or indigenous knowledge that had been claimed in Western patent offices. The practice even had its own menacing nickname - biopiracy. And what started out as a plan to rescue one Indian remedy from the clutches of the U.S. patent office, eventually turned into a much bigger mission  to build a new kind of digital fortress, strong enough to keep even the most rapacious of bio-pirates at bay.

Alert Level 2 | Activation of Alert Level 2 for Kalimantan
The activation of Alert Level 2 indicates persistent dry weather in recent days which had given rise to an escalation in hotspot and smoke haze activities over Kalimantan. The regional haze situation will be updated daily at 0300 and 0900 UTC.

Latest Weather and Haze Situation

Dry weather persisted over the southern ASEAN region today, except over Malaysia and northern Sumatra where there were isolated showers. Under the prolonged dry conditions, moderate to dense smoke haze was observed to emanate from widespread hotspots detected in many parts of Kalimantan. The smoke haze was blown by the prevailing winds northwards, and some of the smoke haze from West Kalimantan had been drifted into western Sarawak, where Unhealthy air quality was reported. Scattered hotspots, some emitting slight to moderate smoke plumes, were detected in southern Sumatra and air quality there was mostly in the Unhealthy level today. Few hotspots were also detected in East Malaysia, but no significant smoke plumes were observed.

For the northern ASEAN region, cloudy and rainy weather prevailed. Isolated hotspots were detected in parts of Viet Nam but hotspot activity in the region remained subdued as a whole. Strong winds and heavy rains continued to affect the northern Philippines due to the influence of Typhoon Haikui, which was observed to strengthen over the Philippine Sea northeast of the archipelago and track west-northwestwards.

Weather and Haze Outlook

Persistent dry weather is forecast for much of the southern ASEAN region south of the Equator over the next few days. With dry conditions forecast to prolong, hotspot and haze situation in the fire-prone areas in Borneo and Sumatra can be expected to escalate. Moderate to dense hazy conditions are likely to continue over the provinces of South Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan. There is also a heightened risk of transboundary haze occurrence over the bordering areas of West Kalimantan and western Sarawak. Over southern Sumatra, the extended dry weather may give rise to hotspot activity and development of localised smoke plumes. The prevailing winds are forecast to blow mainly from the southeast or south.

Over the northern ASEAN region, rainy weather is forecast and hotspot activity is expected to remain low. The prevailing winds are forecast to be southwesterly or westerly. In addition, strong wind conditions and heavy rains are likely to continue over many parts of the Philippines, due to the influence of Typhoon Haikui in its vicinity.

All maps are to be used solely for displaying meteorological/geophysical information, and not for any other purpose. All maps are not to scale and for illustrative purpose only.
The hotspots depicted on the map are derived from the NOAA satellite and they represent locations with possible fires. Hotspots may go undetected due to cloudy conditions or incomplete satellite pass.
At Alert Level 0 and Alert Level 1, the regional haze situation is updated once a day at 0900 UTC. The regional haze situation is updated more frequently at 0300 UTC and 0900 UTC upon activation of Alert Level 2 or Alert Level 3. Updates at 0300 UTC display hotspot information from night-time passes of the NOAA-20 satellite. Fewer hotspots were typically detected at night as fire activities usually peak during the day.
Reprocessed satellite data will be availed at a later timing. The hotspot information derived from satellite data reprocessed may differ slightly from that received near real-time but reprocessing is necessary for better quality data.
The 2500 ft winds (depicted by arrows) are model analysis winds.
Seasonal Forecast for July – September 2023
Summary of Outlook
The Southwest Monsoon conditions were fully established in June 2023 and are expected to continue during the outlook period of July – September (JAS) 2023 with the prevailing low-level winds blowing mainly from the southeast or southwest. With the monsoon rain band situated north of the Equator, drier conditions are typical over the southern ASEAN region under its traditional dry season while wet weather is typical over the northern ASEAN region with widespread and persistent shower activities expected during this period.

For the July to September (JAS) 2023 period, an increased chance of below-normal rainfall is predicted for much of the southern ASEAN region, with highest likelihood over the southwestern Maritime Continent. El Niño conditions are expected to become established during July-August 2023, and then likely to strengthen gradually over the second half of 2023. A positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is likely to develop during July-August 2023. Warmer-than-normal temperature is predicted for most of the ASEAN region for JAS 2023.

Increased risk of elevated hotspot activity and smoke haze occurrence can be expected over the fire-prone areas of the southern ASEAN region during extended periods of dry weather. With an El Niño and a positive IOD forecast to develop during the outlook period, the risk of elevated hotspot activities and transboundary smoke haze occurrence this year is highest since 2019. However, there is still some uncertainty in the strength of the potential El Niño event, with models prediction ranging from borderline to strong El Niño conditions in the outlook period. In the northern ASEAN region, the hotspot activity is expected to remain low under the prevailing wet weather during the outlook period.

SIGN UP  Editors note:  On February 28, 2019, we updated the For developers section with new information about the Google+ APIs We announced  this past fall that were sunsetting consumer Google+ in April 2019, and today have more details to share. While this process of deleting consumer content will take a few months and some content may remain visible during this time, you should take action before April to ensure you dont lose any content you want to save. Many different people use Google+, from everyday consumer users to developers to teams in business settings. Because of this, we want to provide the details you need to navigate this change. Below is more information and recommended actions. For Google+ consumer users Starting April 2, 2019, we will shut down your Google+ account and any pages you created, and we'll begin deleting content from consumer Google+ accounts. Photos and videos from Google+ in your Album Archive and your Google+ pages will also be deleted. If you have Google+ content that you would like to save, you must do so before April 2nd. To get started, please reference these Google+ account  download instructions , which explain how to download and save your content. Check out  this article  on our Help Center or  this list of frequently asked questions  if youre looking for more information. For G Suite users and admins While we bring consumer Google+ to a close, we are continuing our investment in Google+ for the enterprise. You can read more details in  this blog post . This means that for those of you who use Google+ as part of  G Suite , your accounts will remain active. G Suite users include businesses  who pay for its services  and  educational institutions  and other organizations that use G Suite at no cost. If youre not sure if your organization uses G Suite, you can check  here . If youre a G Suite admin, you can get more details about the specific impacts of the consumer Google+ shutdown on the G Suite experience in our  Help Center . For developers who use Google+ APIs Lastly, we are shutting down all legacy Google+ APIs. We recommend that developers migrate to alternative APIs such as  Google Sign-in  and  Google People API. However, for cases where developers are unable to move over before March 7th, we have created a new implementation of some Google+ APIs critical to sign-in only. The new implementation will only return basic fields necessary for sign-in functionality such as name and email address, if authorized by the user. More details  here . Wed like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Google+ users whove built their communities with us over the years. We appreciate what youve created and your contributions. Look out for more enterprise-specific Google+ details later this year.

Effortlessly Split Panes and Navigate Between Code 
With the new  Tab Multi-Select  functionality, tabs become first-class citizens in the interface. A simple modifier when performing actions will split the interface to show multiple tabs at once. Works with the side bar, tab bar, Goto Anything and more!
Side-by-Side Mode for Definitions 
The  Definitions  popup now supports side-by-side mode via the icon, or holding  Ctrl   while clicking a link. Goto Definition, Goto Reference and Goto Symbol in Project also support side-by-side viewing. Explore the full definition, not just a summary in a small popup.
View Definitions in Auto Complete 
When an auto-complete word is a symbol with a definition, click the  Definition  link, or pressing  F12  will open the definition to the right. When focus returns to the original file, the auto complete window will return to its last state.
Use  Multiple Selections  to rename variables quickly 
Here  Ctrl + D  + D  is used to select the next occurrence of the current word.  Ctrl + K ,  Ctrl + D  + K ,   + D  will skip an occurence.
Once created, each selection allows for full-featured editing.
Whats New 
Sublime Text 4 is packed with new features and enhancements, including:
GPU Rendering 
Sublime Text can now utilize your GPU on Linux, Mac and Windows
when rendering the interface. This results in a fluid UI all
the way up to 8K resolutions, all while using less power than
before.
Apple Silicon and Linux ARM64 
Sublime Text for Mac now includes native support for Apple
Silicon processors. Linux ARM64 builds are also available for
devices like the Raspberry Pi.
Tab Multi-Select 
File tabs have been enhanced to make split views effortless,
with support throughout the interface and built-in commands.
The side bar, tab bar, Goto Anything, Goto Definition, auto
complete and more have all been tweaked to make code
navigation easier and more intuitive than ever.
Context-Aware Auto Complete 
The auto complete engine has been rewritten to provide smart
completions based on existing code in a project. Suggestions
are also augmented with info about their kind, and provide
links to definitions.
Refreshed UI 
The Default and Adaptive themes have been refreshed with new
tab styles and inactive pane dimming. Themes and Color Schemes
support auto dark-mode switching. The Adaptive theme on
Windows and Linux now features custom title bars.
TypeScript, JSX and TSX Support 
Support for one of the most popular new programming languages
is now shipped by default. Utilize all of the smart
syntax-based features of Sublime Text within the modern
JavaScript ecosystem.
Superpowered Syntax Definitions 
The syntax highlighting engine has been significantly improved,
with new features like handling non-deterministic grammars,
multi-line constructs, lazy embeds and syntax inheritance.
Memory usage has been reduced, and load times are faster than
ever.
Updated Python API 
The Sublime Text API has been updated to Python 3.8, while
keeping backwards compatibility with packages built for
Sublime Text 3. The API has been significantly expanded,
adding features that allow plugins like LSP to work better
than ever. To learn more, read  the revamped documentation .

Flattr Anti-adblock Pass   Support publishers and enjoy content with fewer ad block walls   Ad blocking helps us have a better online experience. But using an ad blocker also reduces
publishers and sites ability to earn money for the great content they create.         To use Flattr Anti-adblock Pass you need to install and use our Chrome desktop extension,
which you can combine with the ad blocker of your choice.   How it works   Flattr is a paid service that works with your ad blocker by compensating publishers in the
Flattr network via your subscription for the revenue lost to ad blocking. With Flattr, you
contribute to in-network publisher sites, so you see fewer requests to turn off your ad
blocker and dont see ad block walls on these sites.     The Flattr Anti-adblock Pass is also included in:   Adblock Premium  &
Adblock Plus Premium     Start your subscription now       Looking for the old service?   Our old service is closing down. If you want to see old transactions or withdraw money.

CHARTING OUR WAY FORWARD  Forward Singapore 
Since the launch of the Forward Singapore exercise in June 2022, over 14,000 Singaporeans from all walks of life have participated in about 140 engagement sessions on a wide range of topics. Beyond these sessions, many more of you have shared your views and ideas through surveys and other feedback tools. Thank you to everyone who has come forward to participate so far! 
Across the conversations, Singaporeans acknowledged that we are living in a time of change and must relook our current way of doing things. We are emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic into a more uncertain world. Big-power tensions are sending ripples globally. At home, our aspirations are evolving, and we face pressures like a rapidly ageing population and slowing social mobility. All these place more stressors on our society and our people. 
Through the Forward Singapore exercise, Singaporeans are exploring the values, priorities, and policies needed to strengthen our social compact for the next bound of our nations journey. 
From the engagements to date, some common values that our people hold dear have emerged: fairness, inclusiveness, and giving back. Singaporeans also offered varied suggestions, ranging from how we might broaden pathways to success and ensure greater opportunities for all, to strengthening assurance for workers and families. 
These feedback and recommendations informed the thinking behind the five key shifts DPM Wong said Forward Singapore will embark on to refresh our social compact (see DPMs  speech  at the Debate on the Presidents Address 2023).  
A new approach on skills 
A new definition of success 
A  new approach for social support 
A new approach to care for our seniors 
A new emphasis on collective responsibility 
Effecting these shifts will help secure a stronger social compact between this generation and future generations to come.  
The Government has also rolled out some policy changes in this years  Budget Statement  and Committee of Supply debate. 
You can read more detailed findings and related announcements across the six Forward Singapore pillars here . 
In the next phase of Forward Singapore, there will be more engagements to discuss specific issues, and more partnership opportunities for Singaporeans to co-create policy solutions with the Government. Come be a part of it  your contributions will enrich and strengthen the eventual recommendations of Forward Singapore and our shared future. 
The exercise will conclude in the second half of 2023 with the Forward Singapore report. This report will articulate our collective vision for Singapore and offer recommendations for how you and I can come together to realise it. 
Together, we can build a better and brighter Singapore.

The exercise will be organised along six pillars, each headed by 4G leaders:

The Forward Singapore exercise will last a year, and conclude with a report in mid-2023.

Camp Nostalgia 
Community | Mature | Tabletop 
25 & Older Server
Summon the chill-vibes of an endless summer, and step onto the old tie-dye painted bus with Camp Nostalgia stenciled in black along the side.
Inside the bus, its domed ceiling is plastered with stickers from a 50 vending machine. The sticky air smells like zebra-stripe gum and Coppertone 50. Through the radios gentle static, The Verves Bittersweet Symphony plays just below the din of excited voices.
Take empty window seat and gaze out at the passing pines, as the trees grow denser. Someone is handing around a warm, squished bag of gummy worms. Your only cares in the world are if you packed enough AA batteries for your Gameboy Color, and if the Pokmon deck tucked in your JanSport will carry you to victory.
We eagerly await your arrival

Chris Nicholson , Deeplearning4j : 
We have an engineering team and open source community distributed over several
continents, but the conversation lives in one place - and that's Gitter.
Valentin Anastase , Freezing Moon : 
Other communication solutions for the projects Ive been involved in were far from
ideal. Switching to Gitter was one of the best decisions I've made and there's no going
back now.
Troy McConaghy , BigchainDB developer : 
Gitter is the main way people contact us to ask questions about BigchainDB. I guess it
just feels more open, immediate and personal.
Krishna Srinivas , Minio : 
Gitter is the IRC of the post-IRC era. It has helped us at Minio build and connect with
our community really well.
Sam Saccone , Marionette.js Lead : 
Gitter has helped to bring the Marionette community together, turning it into a thriving
collaborative environment that has been exceedingly beneficial to both our endusers and
maintainers.
David Dias , LXJS Conference Organiser : 
Gitter was an essential tool, not only for organising LXJS but to create a thriving
community amongst our attendees before, during and even after the conference.
Doge , Chief Woofing Officer : 
Wow chat. Much awesome. 
Loved by our users 
Gitter is nothing without the people using it day in and day out.

I have migrated to Hostinger few months ago. I am extremely satisfied with the hosting, and with their support.
Migrated over a website and email from another provider. Hostinger's UI is easy to use and the support was quick, friendly, and very helpful.
Very positive experience as a new customer. I migrated my website hosting and the support was amazing and very responsive.

Health on Track @ NTFGH The second session of our    event took place at NTFGH on 18 March 2023, Saturday. The morning started at Block 205 Jurong East Street 21, where residents gathered to witness the completion of ""A Picture of Health @ Jurong East View"", a hand-painted wall mural co-created by more than 50 residents of Jurong East View and our staff. The project is a culmination of our efforts to promote health and empower residents of Bukit Batok East to live well in the community. Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health & Ministry of Law, and Grassroots Advisor to Jurong GRC, joined us and added the finishing touches to the mural. Over at NTFGH, more than 300 participants turned up for a morning of fun-filled and engaging activities. There was an interactive set-up where we shared information on how to make our homes safer for the elderly, education booths where our healthcare professionals provided useful resources and tips, art and craft booths where creativity was unleashed, and a variety of exciting carnival games for everyone in the family. There were also exercise workshops by Active Health SG, as well as a series of public talks where our healthcare experts presented topics ranging from how to prepare nutritious meals for the whole family, how to care for young children at home, how to navigate the healthcare system, and what to look out for when self-medicating. Thank you for all your support for the fourth edition of   !

Health on Track 2023@ NTFGH The second session of our    event took place at NTFGH on 18 March 2023, Saturday. The morning started at Block 205 Jurong East Street 21, where residents gathered to witness the completion of ""A Picture of Health @ Jurong East View"", a hand-painted wall mural co-created by more than 50 residents of Jurong East View and our staff. The project is a culmination of our efforts to promote health and empower residents of Bukit Batok East to live well in the community. Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health & Ministry of Law, and Grassroots Advisor to Jurong GRC, joined us and added the finishing touches to the mural. Over at NTFGH, more than 300 participants turned up for a morning of fun-filled and engaging activities. There was an interactive set-up where we shared information on how to make our homes safer for the elderly, education booths where our healthcare professionals provided useful resources and tips, art and craft booths where creativity was unleashed, and a variety of exciting carnival games for everyone in the family. There were also exercise workshops by Active Health SG, as well as a series of public talks where our healthcare experts presented topics ranging from how to prepare nutritious meals for the whole family, how to care for young children at home, how to navigate the healthcare system, and what to look out for when self-medicating. Thank you for all your support for the fourth edition of   !

You choose what data to share. And with whom. 
Each app is required to ask for your permission so you can choose what data to share. The first time a thirdparty app wants to access your information  like your location, contacts, calendars, or photos  you receive an alert. Even if you grant access once, you can revoke it later. We also ensure that apps are denied access to certain sensitive data on your device, are unable to modify your device or OS, and are prohibited from obtaining complete access to yourdata. 
Over 215K submissions rejected last year for violating privacy guidelines.

You should never have to worry aboutinappropriate content. 
We strongly support all points of view being represented on the AppStore. But we also take steps to make sure apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and we reject apps with any content or behavior that we believe is over the line  especially when it puts children at risk. Every app has an assigned age rating, so parents can determine what is appropriate for theirchildren. 
No surprise purchases. 
More about No surprise purchases. 
No surprise purchases.  
Apps must follow an approved business model and clearly show you the price, tell you what you get with your purchase, and explain subscription-renewal terms up front. Apple sends a receipt each time you use our inapp purchase feature, and you can also view those purchases and subscriptions in your account. So you wont get bills out of theblue. 
Every day, moderators review worldwide AppStore charts for quality and accuracy. 
In 2020, we removed over 80M user reviews that were considered spam.

No senior should have to overpay for life-saving drugs to pad Big Pharmas pockets. My Administration is announcing the first 10 Medicare Part D drugs selected for price negotiation.  We're ending the days of deciding between buying your medicine or putting food on the table.  If you're one of the people who will get some breathing room after prescription drug costs go down, text me at (302) 404-0880 and let me know what this means for you and your family.						 
Earlier this week, before Idalia made landfall, I approved an Emergency Declaration at the request of Governor DeSantis and directed FEMA to pre-deploy resources so we could respond in the hurricanes aftermath as quickly as possible.  As we continue to monitor the storm, teams are on the ground to work with the first responders in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, get people to safety, and begin to recover from the storms impact.								 
I spoke with Govs. DeSantis, Kemp, McMaster, and Cooper to reiterate my Administration's support for response and recovery in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina as Idalia makes landfall.  We'll keep working with personnel on the ground as the storm progresses.

Today, on the 60th Anniversary of the March on Washington, we commit to continue walking towards our nations founding promise.  Reminded of how far weve come. And where we need to go.

I came to office determined to change the economic direction of this country and to move from trickle-down economics to my middle out, bottom up vision:  Bidenomics.								 
Ahead of Labor Day, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule that would ensure more workers receive the pay and benefits they deserve.								 
Under President Bidens economic plan, our economy has remained strong even as we continue to make progress on inflation.								 
This was the front page of UNC-Chapel Hill's Daily Tar Heel.   No student, no parent, and no American should have to send texts like these to their loved ones as they hide from a shooter.   I'll continue to do all I can to reduce gun violence and call on Congress to do the same.

Earlier this week, before Idalia made landfall, I approved an Emergency Declaration at the request of Governor DeSantis and directed FEMA to pre-deploy resources so we could respond in the hurricanes aftermath as quickly as possible.  As we continue to monitor the storm, teams are on the ground to work with the first responders in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, get people to safety, and begin to recover from the storms impact.																	 
I spoke with Govs. DeSantis, Kemp, McMaster, and Cooper to reiterate my Administration's support for response and recovery in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina as Idalia makes landfall.  We'll keep working with personnel on the ground as the storm progresses.																	 
Today, on the 60th Anniversary of the March on Washington, we commit to continue walking towards our nations founding promise.  Reminded of how far weve come. And where we need to go.																	 
I came to office determined to change the economic direction of this country and to move from trickle-down economics to my middle out, bottom up vision:  Bidenomics.																	 
Ahead of Labor Day, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule that would ensure more workers receive the pay and benefits they deserve.																	 
Under President Bidens economic plan, our economy has remained strong even as we continue to make progress on inflation.																	 
This was the front page of UNC-Chapel Hill's Daily Tar Heel.   No student, no parent, and no American should have to send texts like these to their loved ones as they hide from a shooter.   I'll continue to do all I can to reduce gun violence and call on Congress to do the same.

Robotics Grasping Simulation  
Grasping technology, often associated with robotics and automation, addresses the challenge of manipulating and handling objects in various environments. The primary problem solved by grasping technology is the ability to securely and accurately pick up, hold, move, and release objects with different shapes, sizes, and materials. This technology is especially crucial in situations where human intervention may be difficult, dangerous, or inefficient. Before the deployment of new models and algorithms in the real world, it would be great to test the algorithm in a realistic simulation environment first.

High Fidelity Tele-Operation  
Autonomous driving technologies hold promise of substantial manpower savings, but the technology is still not mature enough to remove the driver from the vehicle. This also hinders the deployment of autonomous systems for many business applications as the ROI (Return on Investment) is not justifiable. There are also multiple scenarios, such as firefighting or waste processing, that require the agility offered by a human operator but have worksites that can be harmful. The technology presented here offers a high-fidelity teleoperation solution platform which can control many kinds of vehicles and machinery with high quality video feed at low latency.
This technology is particularly useful for autonomous vehicle or machinery related companies that want to release their fleet to the market and have the option to remove the requirement for a safety driver onboard. It is also useful for companies providing heavy machinery, or end users of heavy machinery who seek to remove operators from harmful worksites.

Highly Sensitive, Multiplex, Spectroscopic - Portable Gas Sensing system  
In the mid-infrared region, gases exhibit absorption spectral features that are typically two orders of magnitude stronger compared to the near-infrared region. This makes the mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL) a highly suitable choice for gas spectroscopy applications. QCLs offer several advantages, including broadband spectral coverage ranging from 3 to 25m, narrow linewidth, compact size, and robustness, which have contributed to their popularity in various spectroscopic applications.
In this context, a portable gas sensor has been developed utilizing self-developed QCL arrays, covering two specific wavelength regimes: 9-10 m and 13-14 m. To further enhance the detection sensitivity, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been integrated into the gas sensor. The incorporation of a hollow-core fiber as a miniaturized gas cell contributes to the overall compactness of the system. By leveraging the capabilities of QCLs, this gas sensor overcomes critical weaknesses associated with existing approaches, particularly their lack of selectivity and inability to differentiate mixtures of gases effectively. We anticipate that this technological innovation will accelerate scientific research progress and prove valuable across various industry sectors.

Reconfigurable Vacuum Suction Gripper  
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and other product components come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and packaging configurations. During the manufacture of such products, a key challenge for automation is to effectively handle and manipulate such diverse products during production or logistical processes. Users planning to automate their production linestypically have to take into consideration the use of either multiple grippers for different product types, or incorporate an automated tool changer with added complexity and cost.
To address this challenge, aSingapore start-up has developed a universal soft robotic gripper designed to manipulate a wider range of product sizes by incorporating a resizeable gripper base. Gripper adjustment is automatically carried out via an integrated computer vision system thus minimizing the need for human intervention during pick-and-place processes. The gripper'ssoft fingers also minimize damage to products during the gripping process.

Water-Trap System and Module Design for Membrane Distillation  
Wetting has been a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of membrane distillation (MD) technology. In MD modules, trapped water on the permeate side can only be removed by draining the modules, which can disrupt the process. The hollow fibers in typical MD units are susceptible to wetting due to a variety of factors, which can reduce their efficiency. In addition, frequent manual intervention is required to drain the water from MD modules.
This technology relates to a water trap system that automates the removal of trapped water from MD modules. The Water-Trap System prevents the accumulation of liquid inside the modules, eliminating the need for manual intervention to stop the process and drain the modules. This can extend the lifespan of the membranes. The system is compatible with any type of membrane (hollow fibers or flat sheet spiral wound). A new module design with a water trap connection for drainage is also included. This new water trap design can be used to improve existing MD systems, increasing the production of pure water or valuable concentrates and extending the lifespan of MD units, especially those with membranes that are more prone to wetting

Nature-Inspired Superhydrophobic Membranes for Membrane Distillation  
Current state-of-the-art lab-scale methods for fabricating superhydrophobic membranes for membrane distillation often involve complex surface modifications or the use of nanomaterials. However, these methods are difficult to scale up.
This technology relates to a pure rheological spray-assisted non-solvent induced phase separation (SANIPS) approach to fabricate superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The resulting membranes have high porosity, superhydrophobicity, high liquid entry pressure, and hierarchical micro/nanostructures. They can also be easily scaled up.
The spraying step caused local distortion of the membrane surface, which induced a two-stage phase inversion. This led to the formation of multilevel polymeric crystal structures. The morphological structures and other membrane properties (e.g., mechanical strength and liquid entry pressure) could be tuned by applying spraying materials with different physicochemical properties.
This facile fabrication method will pave the way for the large-scale production of superhydrophobic membranes for membrane distillation.

Osteoporosis Prediction Enabled by Automated AI System  
Osteoporosis is a significant global public health concern affecting approximately 500 million people. The condition is associated with high mortality and disability rates due to osteoporotic fractures. The management of osteoporotic fractures comes at a considerable cost of SGD 11K per patient in Singapore, placing a growing burden on healthcare budgets as the aging population increases.
Currently, osteoporosis is assessed by measuring bone mineral density (BMD) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the availability of DXA machines, particularly in developing countries, is limited. Consequently, DXA examinations are not routinely ordered, resulting in orthopaedists often lacking DXA results during examinations. Therefore, an alternative method for estimating and screening osteoporosis is necessary.
To address this, an automated AI system that can predict a patient's osteoporotic score by evaluating the CTI (cortical thickness index) from a plain femur X-ray scan is designed and developed. This system would provide a preliminary assessment and enable mass screening for osteoporosis.

Seeking Printable Conductive or Resistive Inks and Materials  
The technology seekeris an established manufacturer of small electrical devices. The company is continually investing in NPD (new product development) and is currently focused on reducing the cost and environmental impact of their products. The electronics industry is investigating the use of conductive and/or resistive inks and materials to replace metallic materials typically used in printed electronics, sensors, heating elements and RFID-based smart packaging, etc. However, many current conductive inks contain silver, which is not acceptable from an environmental standpoint to the company. They therefore wish to identify alternative materials which can still maintain the technical performance required by the end-products.
The companyis actively searching for potential suppliers and technology companies that could support their product development efforts. They have an established customer base and global operations that provide routes to market for both new and established companies. The companyis interested in potential collaboration with groups looking to commercialise relevant technologies and companies who will consider a variety of collaborations, ranging from trading partnerships, licensing through to joint venture and supply.

Seeking Low Temperature Encapsulation Technology Systems for Encapsulation of Flavours and Aromas  
The company is an established manufacturer of FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) products incorporating a range of flavourings (e.g.fruit, herb, botanical or synthetic versions). Flavour molecules with high volatility and a low boiling point (e.g.esters and lactones) tend to evaporate from the product even at ambient temperatures, leading to loss of the desired flavour profile over time.
To extend the freshness and shelf life of these products, it is desirable to protect and stabilise the flavour compounds through encapsulation. Some traditional methods of encapsulating aromas and flavours (e.g. spray drying) require the use of high temperatures which can also lead to loss of volatile compounds and poor encapsulation efficiency. However, recently a number of alternative encapsulation approaches have been developed that operate at low temperatures, and are therefore suitable for use with volatile flavours / aroma molecules.
The company is looking for organisations that will become trusted partners. The companyis open to exploring different ways of working with technology developers starting ideally with collaborative research and development projects; and ultimately exploring other approaches such as licensing of technology with high technical readiness, joint-ventures or technology acquisition.

Seeking Ingredients and Manufacturing Processes to Create Meaty Texture in Plant-based Food  
The technology seeker is a global food manufacturer looking for innovative approaches for introducing meaty texture into plant-based meat and fish. Consumers are interested in plant-based foods because of the health benefits of reducing their meat intake, concerns about farm animal welfare, and the high CO2 emissions linked to livestock farming. However, some consumers who have tried plant-based meat list texture as one of the reasons why they chose not to purchase the products again. The companyis interested in ingredients and manufacturing processes that can create authentic (look and feel) meaty textures in plant-based meat or fish products.
The companyis a large and well-established business with production plants and excellent market access globally. The companyis open to partnerships and collaborations with companies that have relevant technologies in the space to create future products, and so this represents an excellent opportunity for a new and ongoing business relationship.

Seeking Upcycling Technologies for Agri-Food Side Streams to High Value Products  
According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), global food production in 2020 was approximately 5.3 billion metric tons. However, one-third of this total production does not reach consumers' tables. The agrifood industry generates significant amounts of side streams that are often rich in valuable nutrients and compounds. Unfortunately, due to the lack of concerted efforts to aggregate these side streams and implement efficient and sustainable upcycling technologies, they are mostly underutilized. Agriculture, animal, and seafood farming generate substantial volumes of side streams. These side streams include vegetables, coffee beans, cacao, chicken feathers, innards, bones, offals, and scales. They are rich in nutrients and minerals, and there is an interest in seeking new technologies to upcycle them into valuable raw materials for consumption, packaging, or construction materials.
We are currently seeking technologies that are capable of converting agrifood side streamsinto higher-value products. Preferably, the tech provider should be availableforco-development partnerships,R&D collaborations, IP licensing, and acquisition.

Seeking Novel Leavening Technology that Enables Sodium Reduction  
A leading snack company is interested in novel leavening solutions (ingredient and/or process technologies) that enable effective sodium reduction for their baked goods portfolio (savory/salty crackers, sweet cookies).Sodium-based leavening agents (sodium bicarbonate, SAPP etc.) are commonly used in baked goods to deliver the desired product texture and appearance. Finding alternative solutionsthat can deliver the same great consumer experience without elevating the pH is of interest.

Whistle Blowing 
2022  HBPTC  All Rights Reserved   
Residents of all ages enjoy community gardening activities. It not only teaches us to be self-sufficient but also creates bonding opportunities. 
I was pleasantly surprised to know that the area I live in, under Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council, is the first town council to have a sustainability report. The existing sustainability-driven initiatives, including the change of lighting to LEDs and various recycling programmes, are a step in the right direction. Some new initiatives that I feel can be explored range from moving towards a single-use plastic free town, and understanding our towns carbon footprint from which we can identify areas of improvement. On a larger scale, we can look into the sustainability of our built environment, such as the source of construction materials and techniques used. 
One way to reduce waste is to buy goods unpackaged. You can easily find them in our own neighbourhoods, such as sundry shops and wet markets that often sell edible items by weight. Instead of getting them in plastic bags, simply bring your own containers to fill. Doing so helps to reduce the amount of packaging waste. A tried and tested shop that you can get freshly ground coffee is Huat Soon Heng Coffee Powder at Bukit Timah Market. The friendly uncle will even mix beans so you can make your own special blend! This enables us to support local as well as be eco-friendly. 
I personally feel that Bukit Panjang has fared well in many of the sustainability goals, especially with the PV installation on rooftops, the large number of community gardens and nature parks, recycling initiatives and also recreational activities available, along with its residents involvement. Being a community gardener, I believe that preserving the rustic look rather than sprucing up the gardens will foster a stronger community, as local gardeners associate themselves with the identity of the gardens that they have built over the years. 
I feel it is important to talk about recycling, sorting, and the transparency of recycling results in the Town Council and beyond, as well as the steps towards achieving a circular economy for the future. However, even prior to recycling, there needs to be more awareness about reducing onetime- use materials such as plastic food containers and drinking cups. I hope to see HBPTC adopting some of the suggestions, such as educating hawkers and setting up composting programmes. 
ALBA is honoured to work with the Town Council to make circularity a reality for e-waste. We have set up disposal channels such as e-bins across the town to collect and recycle e-waste. 
Zhenghua Park 
The 17.3-ha linear Zhenghua Nature 
Park stretches for about 2.5km along Bukit Timah Expressway, linking Bukit Panjang Park Connector to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Apart from native flora such as Tembusu and Jejawi, 37 bird species have been spotted in the park, including the Flameback Woodpecker, Pink-necked Green Pigeon, Greater Racket-tailed Drongo and Long-tailed Parakeet. Long-tailed macaques, squirrels, monitor lizards and many other animals are also a common sight in the park. 
Pang Sua Park Connector 
Starting from Zhenghua Park, it runs all the way to Bukit Panjang Park and connects with Villa Verde Park. Spot Eagles, White-bellied Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and Pacific Swallow (Hirundo tahitica), as well as the Common Grass Yellow (Eurema hecabe contubernalis) and Plain Tiger (Acerbas chrysippus chrysippus) butterflies. 
Dairy Farm Nature Park 
Formerly a cow shed, the Wallace Education Centre now houses an education gallery where visitors can learn about the biogeography and biodiversity of our region. 
Bukit Panjang Butterfly Garden 
Situated along Bukit Panjang Road, it is linked to the Pang Sua and Zhenghua Park Connector network that links to biodiversity- rich areas like Dairy Farm Nature Park and, further south, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Red Tree Bush (Leea rubra), a butterfly nectaring plant, sits right in the centre of the VIP planter bed, which attracts forest butterflies. 
Ulu Pandan Park Connector 
Starting from Commonwealth Avenue West, this connector runs through the Ghim Moh estates, Dover MRT station, Holland Grove estates and the Van Kleef Centre, a water research centre.

Braided Chestnut (Castanopsis inermis), Singapore Walking-Stick Palm (Rhopaloblaste singaporensis) and the Jelutong (Dyera costulata) are some of the trees found here. 
Chairman's Message			 
Sustainability has always been one of the cornerstones of our focus on town management. Since Dr Teo Ho Pins time as the chairman of the Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council, it is enshrined in our work pertaining to township governance. Whether it is driving recycling efforts, stepping up our biophilic initiatives, and making our town more energy- efficient, we sustain the momentum by launching initiatives and technological innovations that make sustainability a fact of life for all. 
Noteworthy here is the fact that all this is done against the backdrop of changing demographics. For instance, Bukit Panjang is home to Together, we embark on this sustainability journey a predominantly ageing community. There are more seniors now and our estates are also getting older  many precincts are entering the 30-year mark and some are even older. 
In the next stage of our green plan, we have to dovetail our green initiatives with our rejuvenation plans. As such, our Neighbourhood Renewal Programmes have a green focus. We rethink the way our community centres, for example, are being designed so as to allow for better natural ventilation, which further brings down energy consumption. We have invested in energy-efficient LED lighting and encouraged the proliferation of community gardens and green spaces throughout our town. 
Energy-efficiency not only reduces carbon emission but also keeps it affordable for our residents. We also want to explore water saving solutions through the use of devices such as jet equipment by our cleaners to wash the common areas. These devices can minimise water usage. Similarly, for households, we advise our residents on how they can minimise water consumption by installing water-saving devices on their taps and reducing their utility bill expenses. 
An integral aspect of our approach towards sustainability is how we procure materials for our Towns rejuvenation programmes  the entire supply chain ecosystem has to be aligned with our sustainability objectives that emphasise materiality and circularity. For example, the paint that we use for the Repair and Redecoration works in our estates are environmentally friendly and dont contain harmful chemicals. We ensure that the suppliers from whom we procure goods in the course of our town management work have the green accreditation mark. In the past few years, there has been a palpable shift in our town planning and management work. It is also intrinsically linked to the SG Green Plan 2030 as well as the Action for Green Town initiative. 
We are also looking at synergies between sustainability and mobility. Many of our residents have embraced cycling as their main mode of transportation. We are working closely with Land Transport Authority and pressing on with our cycling network to connect our Town as well as the various park connectors better, and make them more user-friendly and accessible. 
One growing area of concern is the increase in the amount of waste generated during the pandemic. Our cleaners have witnessed the bins filling up fast, both in residential areas as well as the Towns commercial centres and food markets. We hope to create awareness about responsible consumption and its impact on reducing our carbon footprint. 
We are talking to companies about the potential of waste composting. As a progressive town council supported by our community of residents who are actively seeking ways to live a greener and healthier lifestyle, we are always open to new and innovative ideas that add value to our sustainability objectives.

Bangladesh is floating in the tide of development! How much development in the vicinity! Every year our country is moving forward from 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G. There are big SIM companies,big data pack but no network. We have Bangabandhu satellite which is not working again. We have the power to take on big projects but we can't stop ourself from stealing the country's money.We love corruption.We have a lot of MPs who steal huge money in the name of budget, every year.We have corruption in our veins. We can leave parents but not corruption. We are Bengalis, in corruption and oppression.We believe in the certification business not in efficiency. We claim to be digital, but when we see a digital program, we put the Forbitten tag.Our country does not have a good secure platform because we believe in copy paste code.In a country where goats are made ICT ministers, isn't dreaming of a digital country a false luxury?...Save the country from destruction X save yourself",1

So you want to modify the text of a PDF by hand

So you want to modify the text of a PDF by hand... 
If you, like me, resent every dollar spent on commercial PDF tools,
you might want to know how to change the text content of a PDF without
having to pay for Adobe Acrobat or another PDF tool. I didn't see an
obvious open-source tool that lets you dig into PDF internals, but I
did discover a few useful facts about how PDFs are structured that
I think may prove useful to others (or myself) in the future. They
are recorded here. They are surely not universally applicable -- 
the PDF standard is truly Byzantine -- but they worked for my case.

Our Residents   Say 
Dear Sir / Madam, 
I am writing to thank and commend Mr Andy Loh from Jalan Besar Town Council for the way he handled the cases I brought to his attention. After I sent in a case, he would call me and discuss whats the next steps and what action hes going to take. He have handled all the cases in a very professional way. I truly appreciate his dedication and commitment. Kudos for his help and assistance. 
Have a good weekend and stay safe. 
David Lim 
(Resident of Kolam Ayer) 
Recently, near Blk 95a flight of steps were resurfaced to non-slip granite chips. After that the three chairs which were there originally were not put back. 
I called JBTC n Mr Cheong, the estate officer called me at about 9pm n told me to meet him the next day. We met n he took some pictures n promised me he would take up the matter with the contractor. 
True enough, a few days later, two workers came and fixed the chairs back. 
Undoubtedly this is his duty but what impressed me was his work ethic, the eagerness n desire to help to fix the problem. 
Sir I am grateful to him and wish to thank him. The Residents here are very fortunate to have him as our estate officer. 
The credit must also go to you Ken Soon for instilling such good work ethic in your staff. 
P/S   please kindly look into the feasibility of putting up a ramp at blk94. 
Thank you. 
Regards,                                     
Kok Peng   (Resident of Kreta Ayer - Kim Seng) 
Hi Cindy, 
Mr Quek came by and two posters were put up at the walls where the dogs usually urinate. 
Hopefully the issue will be resolved.  
Thanks Mr Quek Teng Zao, for the prompt action.                                     
Ms Jen Goh   (Resident of Whampoa) 
Greetings, Ken Wee! 
Thanks for your immediate attention and revert. 
My apologies for the numerous feedback. 
From the look of it we thought it was a crack. Thanks to your team for the investigation and immediate attention. 
Thanks and regards  
Swaminathan  
Thank you and have a good weekend ahead!

Dear Afzan, 
Thank you so much for your quick actions. 
Very much appreciated. 
Best regards,                                     
Eugene   (Resident of Kolam Ayer) 
Dear Andy Lim, 
We have monitored the smell situation for a day, and are happy to say that the rubbish stench from the chute seems to be negligible now. This may well be the first time, in weeks that we have moved in, that we can leave our kitchen windows closed and not suffer the aftereffects of the whole house smelling bad.  
Thank you for your help and hopefully this level of cleanliness can be maintained. 
Best Regards,

How does a password manager work? Remembering all your work and personal passwords is difficult. A password manager makes it easy by remembering them for you. Password managers also enable you to share passwords with groups and individuals, so you and your team can work more efficiently. Plus, your information syncs seamlessly across your devices, so youll always have access to your logins when you need them, even if youre offline. With a password manager, you can generate, save, and autofill unique, complex passwords. That means youll never have to remember or enter a complex password again. Password managers also help businesses improve their cybersecurity. Admins can protect their organization by setting policies to easily onboard, offboard, and manage employees access to work accounts. When creating an account, members that arent using SSO are asked to set a strong Master Passwordthe encryption key used to unlock the account. Dashlane encrypts all your data and never stores or transmits your Master Password, which means only you can access your vault, even in the unlikely event of a server breach. If your organization uses SSO, youll use your SSO login for Dashlane and wont need to create a Master Password. Is Dashlane secure? What if Dashlane gets hacked? Is it safe to save all my passwords in one place? Dashlane leads the industry in security, and all the passwords and personal information you save in Dashlane can only be unlocked with your Master Password or SSO credentials. We never store or transmit your Master Password, and we encrypt all your data. Can Dashlane see my passwords?  No. Dashlane cant see your logins or personal information because of our zero-knowledge security system. Anywhere we store your logins or personal information, including our servers, your data is encrypted using state-of-the-art security systems. Why is Dashlane better than storing passwords in my browser or device (Chrome, Keychain, and more)? While storing your passwords in a web browser, such as Chrome or Safari, is very convenient, its also risky because most browsers dont encrypt that information. Cybercriminals can find ways to retrieve your passwords remotely and access your accounts. Dashlane, on the other hand, encrypts your information and uses zero-knowledge architecture to protect it. Additionally, Admins have more control with a password manager, including an Admin Console to configure policies and settings. They also have tools to manage and monitor users, giving them visibility into the organizations security.  Is Dashlane easy to use? Our mission is to make security simple for organizations and their people. Dashlane is easy to use and adopt and offers a sleek interface and intuitive apps with industry-leading Autofill and SSO on the web and mobile. And were not the only ones who think so: Our 4.5-star ratings on G2 and the Chrome store speak to our award-winning UX. We also offer step-by-step onboarding for organizations and have a robust  Help Center  that we update often. And for any questions that come up along the way, our top-notch Customer Support team is always standing by. Is Dashlane open source? In an effort to increase transparency and trust, we took the first step of making the source code of our Android and iOS apps publicly available. Anyone can audit the code and understand how we build mobile apps, and explore the algorithms and logic behind password management software in general. Our security doesnt rely on having closed source codesoftware can always be deobfuscated through reverse engineering. In fact, our source code is already exposed to auditors, who can find vulnerabilities through fuzzing, dynamic application testing, and automated source code analysis. Ultimately, the security of software depends on the quality of the codeand thats why Dashlane developers, auditors, and security researchers give our code the highest level of attention and scrutiny. Why choose Dashlane? Dashlane Password Manager is uniquely designed to be easy to use and practical for anyone. Onboarding is painless, sharing is simple, and Autofill makes it easy to log in quickly and effortlessly. Some password managers feel technical and complex, but Dashlane has an intuitive interface and offers human support through email, live chat, and phone* in case you have questions.

It is more famous than I am."" Gustave Eiffel, civil engineer Are they dancing? These abstract figures appear to be in a celebratory mood, matching the bright, bold palette and wild energy of Delaunay's painting. The great tower Robert Delaunay saw the Eiffel Tower as a symbol of modernity  standing for the future and the triumph of technology. What are these colorful circles? Color was at the center of Delaunay's theories about painting. He believed that when juxtaposed with other colors, it could convey form, depth, light and even emotion. For Delaunay, color was a subject for art in itself, just like a vase of flowers or the Eiffel Tower.

The Most Popular WordPress Theme In The World And The Ultimate WordPress Page Builder 
Divi  is our flagship theme and visual page builder. It's the most widely used premium WordPress theme in the world according to stats from BuiltWith.com. Divi is more than just a theme, it's a website building framework that makes it possible to design beautiful websites without ever touching a single line of code and without installing and configuring dozens of disjointed plugins. We think this is the future of WYSIWYG and it's unlike any WordPress theme you have ever used before.

PATIENT CARE 
Have a non-emergency condition? Think GP First! Having bad stomach cramps after eating mala hotpot? Consult your General Practitioner (GP) first, instead of heading to the SKH Emergency Department (ED). If the GP deems your condition to be an emergency after an assessment, he will refer you to SKH under the GPFirst scheme. In addition, you will receive a S$50 subsidy on the hospital's attendance fee for GP referrals under this scheme.

Dementia 
We naturally worry for our aging loved ones as they become forgetful over time, thinking it might be an early onset of dementia. Dementia, however, is not a disease in itself.

Depression 
Feeling sad and depressed is a natural response to setbacks and loss. For most of us, over time we learn to overcome our problems or accept changes in our lives. But for others, the sense of despair can become so severe that it dominates their lives.

SG Clean Day in Toa Payoh Central
BTPTC team and volunteers of Toa Payoh Central participated in SG Clean Day, in Zone 5 and Zone 6. 
From Our Residents 
Hi BTPTC, 
I am a resident of Blk 155 Lor 1 Toa Payoh. 
I am writing to thank the Town Council and especially Mr Julius Teo for the quality of service and assistance rendered. 
As a new resident, my family faced a few issues pertaining to our flat and Mr Julius Teo has been of great assistance. He assisted my family with the repair of the building paintwork, an external wall, as well as my riser doors Throughout the process, he provided me with timely updates. 
He has been extremely conscientious and meticulous. Another example of Mr Teos excellent service is how he noticed that the refuse chute hopper was damaged and took the initiative to get it replaced. 
We appreciate the team and Mr Teo for the hard work. 
Phoon Jun Jie 
Thomas Lim is very responsive to our feedback. He does his duties very well, and he is very responsible and caring.  
Keep up the good work! 
Thank you, Thomas!

Thank you for your help. Grateful for it. 
Bert Lee 
The pavement with shelter from block 161 Toa Payoh to the nearest bus stop has been completed. Those old folks said finally they can walk through here from the bus stop specially during rainy days. Thanks for the foreign workers the contractors the town council officers for the great work. 
Armani Innerfree 
Hi Thomas, 
Much appreciated of your swift action. This effort goes a long way in making our estate clean and green. 
Compliments to you, your staff together with the conservancy workers who have been diligently keeping our estate clean. I have to been to many estates and those about the same age as ours look like they are not as well kept as our estate. 
On a side note, I appreciate that your conservancy workers whom remove the rubbish from the chute have done a good job keeping things neat as well as keeping the noise level low. It is a job which is not appreciated much and would like to thank them. 
Best regards, 
Mark Lee 
Thanks Lorraine for the quick work on this. Greatly appreciate it! 
Vivian Sim 
Dear Lorraine, 
Thank you for the update and working on this issue so promptly. We really appreciate your help.

Jonah Lim 
Dear Miss Celestine Gang, 
Thank you for your email. 
I refer to the tele-conversation this afternoon with your goodself, pertaining to the removal request. Thank you very much for your support and service to the elderly in need. 
Best regards, 
Jane Ting 
I wish to commend your staff, Mr Tang for assisting to look into the water pressure matter for my unit. He has also assisted to escalate the matter to PUB for their further actions and co-ordinate with PUB to resolve the issue. He has rendered excellent quality service. Thank you. 
Yeo Pei Ling

My wife and me would like to thank you and the organising committee for organising and inviting us to the above dinner, and giving us an opportuniyty to interact with the residents of i96 and197 and also shared our views on the estate improvement to make BISHAN an ideal place to live in.

She has expeditiously and effciently get the signage put up above the 3 seaters bench at the void deck of 197 to request users of the seat to give up the seat fot the aged n mobility problems  
Hopefully more of our suggestions and feedbacks could be implemented 
Finally i would like to thank all for the sumptuous dinner and helps rendered

Dear Sir / Madam, 
I would like to compliment one of your staff , Syafiq of Toa Payoh Town Council. 
Syafiq has been assisting me on the external maintenance of my flat. Syafiq was very helpful, polite and patient. 
What's most important is that he followed up on the issues and resolved them. These are the attributes of good customer service. 
Well done Syafiq & many thanks again! You are a great ambassador for the Town Council. 
Julianne 
I would l would like to compliment Mr Ahmad, the toilet cleaner at Blk 22 Lor7.  
He is very hardworking and always keep the toilet clean at all time. 
Doris Chan 
We were facing waste water raining into our unit from the unit above us, so I called BTPTC to seek help. They arranged for a contractor to assess our kitchen pipe within a few hours. Mr Robin the officer from BTPTC patiently explained a resolution plan and addressed my concerns timely. With Robins help, the leakage issue was resolved on the same day! We are very thankful for his commitment to help us and grateful to the BTPTC team as well! Thank you! 
Kam Wai Mun 
Dear Sir, I wish to register my heartfelt thanks to Mr Ray, who attended my issue of water leakage at the piping system in the kitchen area. His attentiveness and prompt follow-up augurs well for town council and he is very professional in dealing with Jasper, HDB branch on the co-ordination works. He indeed adds value to Bishan-TPY TC and kudos to Mr Ray.  
Lewis Lee  
We would like to compliment on the lady cleaner that takes pride in her cleaning of the void deck most mornings. Good job and keep it up!   
Benjamin 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
I just wanna comment Mr Yeo who has been cleaning my block 191, Bishan Street 13, ever since he took over the cleaning, I must comment that he did a great job, our staircases and corridors are well swept and I just wanna make sure TOWN COUNCIL is aware of his good works. 
Thank you from a resident of BLK 191, Bishan Street 13, 5th Floor 
Mrs Soh 
I would like to say thank you for arranging the contractor to prune the trees promptly. 
Have a nice day! 
Sam 
I wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to your team of very dedicated and honest workers. Earlier this morning, a Chinese man and and an Indian man, which i assumed to be part of the cleaning team, came to my unit to return my sons wallet, containing his NRIC and other cards (school). Apparently, my son had dropped it and was later found by the same Indian man who came to returned it this morning. In my excitement, I had not taken their names earlier and wish to express our gratitude through this email. Please accept my family sincere appreciation of their assistance and good work! Excellent workers!! Well done! 
Rohaya Binte Sidik 
I am a new resident of Toa Payoh Blk 159 Lorong 1 #08-1550; having just moved in recently, I would like to compliment the cleaners of the estate. Having been here for about a month, I am amazed at the number of rubbish people discard at the bins on level 1 every evening when I get home, only to have it magically disappear every morning when I leave the house to go to work. When cleaning the corridors, they are also very diligent and always cheery (its one Malay Pak Cik, but I did not catch his name). They are the unsung heroes of our clean and green city, and I want to ensure they are recognised for their hard work. 
Mandy Ang 
Ms Rolynn &6/6 (3.30pm) 
SOH PEK HAR 
I write just to express my appreciation to one of your staff, whom if I am not wrong is also a new staff. His name is Mr. Ahmad Nur Shaniq. 
Mr. Ahmad Nur Shaniq is the first town council staff whom I have come across in my 36 years as a Bishan Resident, as a very well trained service staff. He is always so prompt to answer his calls within the 1st 3 rings, following up on my case from 12th Apr 2022 to 11th May 2022 almost every week, despite the fact, at end of Apr 2022, my case was handed over to the HDB area. I told him yesterday is just do a last favor to help me to ensure the HDB officer who came down to my place to check on the leakage of the ceiling does her follow-up with me. He can simply close off my case with him as it is the HDB job role now. 
For the past years, I always experienced ""long waiting replies"" to my emails and it was always I was the one who has to do the follow-up myself, it was like if I don't push it never gets done, but this round it was vice versa. 
I hope you could pass my message to Mr. Ahmad to keep it up with his good work attitude and I really thank him so much for all his help and patience with me. 
Imagine someone going through fasting month and yet doing his job so well, without showing any signs of impatience with the requestor. Especially the requestor who is myself does actually made some special request and he did his best to meet my request. 
Thank you so much Mr. Ahmad Nur Shaniq and may God bless you and your family always. I will always remember your kind help to me. 
Eunice Wong 
I am writing to express my appreciation to you and your team for the newly opened water playground and community park in front of Blk 144 at Toa Payoh. The park was opened yesterday and we heard lots of laughter and saw the priceless joy on the children's faces when we brought our kids, age eight and ten, to the water playground this morning.Covid has brought about many unprecedented challenges for the past two years and until a few months ago, it was imaginable that life will ever be the same as pre-Covid time again. We all have our own challenges and financial difficulties, mental stress and children's study seems like a never ending circle. However, when I reflected over my personal encounter, one of the things that hit me the most during the last two years was the silence that greeted me every time I passed by the playground during the circuit breaker period. It was surreal to see the playground being cordoned off, in dead silence. I was overwhelmed with sadness every time I passed by a playground - a playground should be filled with laughter, not silence. Many people find children noisy, but parents will know that amidst the challenges in bringing up our (noisy) children, their laughter and joy is what keeps us going when the going gets tough. They are our future and to many, the purpose in life. 
A BIG thank you for bringing back life to this lovely neighborhood. Thank you for putting the laughter on the children's faces. Thank you for giving our future generation a nurturing community environment and letting them know that it is possible to have access to such a wonderful community park, which once belongs to perhaps only the elite in Singapore (who can afford expensive park entrance fee). 
The last time we saw you at the TPY Central bursary award, we were concern about your health as we saw that you were walking with difficulty, not knowing you were probably recovering from a medical procedure. It was great seeing you up and well again, and even testing the NB running shoes for SAF ;). Do take good care of yourself as we understand the heavy reasonability which you are carrying on your shoulders. Please know that even though many Singaporeans love to complain, there are also many out there who are appreciative of what the government has done, and is continuously doing for its people. 
Here is wishing you a wonderful weekend. 
May you and your family be blessed with good health, peace and joy, always. 
Resident of Blk 153 TPY Central 
To the managers, officers and staff of Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council 
With Love, Thank You.

Mr Tay 
Had an issue with the kitchen drainage pipe a couple of weeks ago. The PO in charge, who sadly i did not get his name even though we kept in contact to solve the issue, promptly identified the issue as a choke. Issue was raised up on friday. He wanted to come by the next day but I rejected his offer and insist him to come down on a weekday instead as it's not an urgent case. Monday he came by, identified the root cause and activated the plumber to settle the choke at level 1. Thanks to him the choke was cleared off before the problem worsen. This PO do have the resident's problem as his priority, know the signs of common issues, and is quick to solve the issues. This sort of PO is hard to come by, and I hope he won't get over worked to a burnt out stage as many PO in other town council faces. It's nice to have him in charge of this zone. Thank you!

I would like to compliment the Bishan Toa-Payoh Town Council quick actions taken after I log an incident via the One Service App. 
I observed there are a lot of unattended/abandoned plantsunder the Bishan Block 229. Town Council did a quick check on this matter and was able to communicate to those plants owner. A notice was hanged up on the plants and highlighted that ...This is an infringement to the Town Council by-laws 12(1)... and provided a deadline of removal by 15 Jun 2021. 
I am looking forward that Town Council will remove all those plants after 15 Jun 2021 and restore the clean and tidiness of our community.  
Town Council, well done so far and lets keep our Bishan clean and tidy.

Dear Lorraine, 
Many many thanks for your work and the people on the ground. 
I am sure many residents will appreciate your hard work. 
I definitely felt the difference in not getting any bites these few days. 
I am thankful for that. I am even more grateful that you are keeping me posted. 
As a resident, I will also be trying very hard to ensure I do not create any breeding grounds for mosquitoes. 
Thanks and stay safe!

Dear Mr Freddie, 
We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to Mr Andy Ang, Property Executive of Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council for his excellent work and support to Toa Payoh East Zone 6 RC, particularly to Blk 261 to 264 Toa Payoh East. 
It is indeed great to have Mr Andy Ang taking charge of the estate and keeping the common areas in a good and clean condition. From the feedback I have received from many residents and RC members, Andy has been relentlessly helping residents to resolve their issues and has been very patient in attending to their feedback. We are also appreciative that Andy has often attended to our messages and calls after office hours to resolve the problems faced by the residents through the RC's chatgroup. Even earlier today, he responded promptly to a feedback on dumping of debris at Apex. 
We would like to thank Mr Andy Ang for his good work and support and we look forward to work with both yourself and Mr Andy Ang to make our estate a better place. 
Thank you.

Hi Fen, 
I would like to say there is marked improvement in the design of the 2021 desktop calendar compared to 2020's. At least the photos are well taken and there are design elements in the header of each month. Finally it doesn't look like a DIY project by some layman who has no design sense. Hope to see more well designed calenders in the future. Thank you.

We (residents) like to express our sincere appreciation & gratitude to Mr Mohd Farhan (8 years - Longest serving Property Executive in Bishan North Zone 4) for his dedication services to keep in our area SAFE and his effort on Pest Control. The following was what he did for our zone during COVID-19 period this year 2020. 
- Repaired the centre divider (curb stones) on our service roads & painted white for heading & ending of the dividers (visible during wet & dark nights), especially for elderly drivers having poor vision at night. 
- Personally led the cleaners on rats & mynahs population control (I saw with my own eyes). 
- Clearing obstacles displayed 24/7 that occupied the public corridor by shop tenant. During heavy rain, passers-by were unable to walk (Social Distancing Measures) and thus risking the spread of the infectious COVID-19 Virus. 
- Empathy attitude towards residents' need on home-grown fruit trees along Marymount Road. 
- Immediately removed loosen damaged bind metal rod that dangles (dangerous and may be fatal when hit on elderly head). 
Thank you Mr Mohd Farhan for serving our Zone 4 for the past 8 years and we wish you good health and happy working in other areas. We definitely welcome you back in Zone 4.  
Mr David 
I would like to showmy appreciation and thank your Ms Vanessa Lim for responding to my feedback so quickly that sign boards are put up at the Bishan Neighbourhood Park in front of Blk 186 and 187 to advise visitors to the park to lower their voices after 10pm. I hope this will help to bring peace and quietness to the surrounding area.  Another point worth praise mentioning is that the neighbourhood park is being maintained very well recently. Please keep it up, and help extend my appreciation to all your staff and contractors. 
Mr Loke 
Dear Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council,

Hi Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council, 
Thank you for your email reply. I would like to applaud the Town Council for always being so prompt and responsive. Really appreciate it. Kudos to Bishan Town Council officers and team. 
Daphne 
I called Town Council for assistance as I saw huge swarm of insects swirling outside the windows of my home's living room. Your staff clearly demonstrated how competent she was in managing the issue. she made effort to continuously engage me on her action plan. She clearly has the right attitude towards work. She knows the importance of engagement via communications. Good job. Veron, thank you for putting together such an effective, competent and responsible team! 
Ms Ong 
I would like to give an excellent satisfactory comment to the fast response to my feedback on the block rubbish chute odour issue. I noticed the TC staffs doing water flushing to the chute from the top down and washing at the bin areas. Keep up the good job. You have my thumb up!! Thank you for the fast response. 
Mr Choo 
I am writing to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude that in spite of the present situation, I have noticed that every day without fail, the corridors are swept clean and block washing still proceeds without interruption. As I am now working from home, I have noticed the town council workman who sweeps the corridor every day without fail. Thus the cleanliness and upkeep of the block has gone on smoothly with no interruption. The same goes for block washing and refuse removal. I thank you that cleanliness is still maintained. Thank you for maintaining the block and also for looking after the men who go about tirelessly in their work with their face masks on daily. It really heartens me. Thank you. 
Charles 
My purpose to send you the email is to let you know of a cleaner going the extra mile. 
Yesterday morning I was trying to change the punctured tyre of my car. Steven, a part time cleaner from Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council, came over to assist. He practically did the changing of the punctured tyre for me. I would like to thank him for the extra mile and Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council in having compassionate staff who goes the extra mile to assist the residents. Thank you. 
Mr Lim 
My compliment to your Property Officer at Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council. I had submitted feedback on several occasions. Noted that shehas been understanding and prompt attending to the issues. Once again, thank-you for your prompt action and professionalism. 
Mdm Choo 
This morning, I was jogging near RGS when I felt sick and both knees start to weaken, and very hungry out of the sudden. One of your staff was nearby and I requested the location of the nearest police post to ask for help. Out of her pocket, she bought me an energy drink from a vending machine. I was not carrying a phone or cash. After the drink, I was well enough to walk back home. Please thank her on my behalf. I will make time to drop by to return her the money. 
Mr Ng 
To the managers and staff of Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council: 
Best Wishes and With Love

"The Worlds Platform for Change  Change.org 
Skip to main content Start a petition My petitions Browse The worlds platform for change 513,962,322 people taking action. Victories every day. Start a petition Featured Victories Victory PM Lee: Support for Tenants in Singapore, especially the non essential businesses Dear PM Lee and Minister of Law K Shanmugam, 
We would like to propose: 
1) The law to mandate landlords to waive rental for one month for non essential businesses. This is on top of the mandatory property tax rebate which was mandated to be passed down to tenants. 
2) Late interest fees on 2 months rental payments to be waived. Late interest fees will continue to accrue for the other months as per rental contract. 
Tenants are locked in on rental agreements with landlords. Due to the extended circuit breaker announced, tenants of non essential businesses are forced to close for 2 months. During these two months, most of these non essential business are unable to operate at all and earn zero revenue as a result. Yet, many of the tenants have high rental payments that continue to accumulate. Tenants have been recommended to speak to our landlords but many of us are facing roadblocks as the landlords refused to speak to us or hear our request. The temporary measures bill that was passed allows rental to be suspended for 6 months. However, it was announced on 20 April 2020 that late interest payments and rental payments will accrue depending on the rental contracts. Some of these tenancy contracts charge exorbitant interest rates but we were not able to predict that we will be forced to close for two months. Tenants all wish to operate their businesses at the rented premises and continue to pay rentals in a timely manner. Tenants are already suffering directly from the impact of the dwindling businesses during operation. Landlords, on the other hand, are just tasked to pass on the property tax rebates to tenants, not sharing the burden of the crisis. 
I put forward two propositions as above. Firstly, landlords need to share the burden of the crisis just like everyone else. Assuming their unit is currently empty, are they able to rent out their unit to any tenant in such economic circumstances? Secondly, late interest fees on 2 months rental payments which were suspended should be waived given that zero revenue is earned during the forced closure period. 
I quote Law Minister K Shanmugam: In such a situation, you don't talk contract. You talk equity, you talk justice, you talk about what is the right thing to do... The State looks at who can bear the pain more, and it's also sharing of the pain. If you insist on your minutest, every single contractual right at this point, that will suck the life out of the economy. You've got to protect everyone.

Frequently asked questions 
Expand
Collapse
How does a family group work? 
When you create a family group, you become the family manager. This means that you can invite up to five other people to join, and if they accept your invitation, theyll be added to your family group. Family managers can delete the group, invite or remove members at any time.  Get started by creating your family group now. 
How much does a family group cost? 
Creating or joining a family group doesnt require a paid membership or subscription. A family group allows you and your family group members to get more out of the Google products that you already use. Some Google products require purchasing family plan subscriptions for premium services. 
What can I share in a family group? 
Once you create a family group, you'll see a list of Google apps and services that the family manager can choose from for the family to share. 
I have children in my family group. How are they supervised? 
Family managers can manage their parental controls for supervised accounts in a family group. The family manager can also give another parent parental permissions to help  manage a supervised account. 
Are there any restrictions or requirements? 
To create a family group, you must be 18 or older (or the  applicable age of consent in your country ). In order to join your family group, the people that you invite must have a Google Account. People can only join one family group at a time and they can only switch to another family group once every 12 months. 
Are family group and Family Link related? 
Family group and Family Link are two different services that can work together. With a family group youre able to share your favourite apps and services like YouTube, Play Family Library, Google Assistant and more.
When you create a child account in your family group, thats where Family Link comes in. Family Link allows you to set digital ground rules for your childs account, such as restricting content, approving app downloads and purchases, setting screen time and more.  Learn more about Family Link. 
Where can I learn more? 
For more information on how a family group works, what you and your family can share, and other details,  visit the Google for Families Help Centre.

Artculo destacado Savage Amusement 
Savage Amusement 
Savage Amusement  es el dcimo  lbum de estudio  de la banda alemana de  hard rock  y  heavy metal   Scorpions , publicado en 1988 por los sellos  Harvest / EMI  para  Europa  y por  Mercury Records  para los  Estados Unidos . Su grabacin estuvo marcada por conflictos internos, como la presin por repetir el xito de  Love at First Sting  de 1984 y la imposicin por parte de su  management  y  PolyGram  empresa matriz del sello Mercury de incorporar elementos del  glam metal , subgnero del  metal  que imperaba en el mercado estadounidense. Sin embargo, la principal disputa ocurri entre la banda y  Dieter Dierks , ya que el  productor  quera replicar el sonido del lbum  Hysteria  de  Def Leppard , plagado de efectos de estudio y  digitalizacin . Si bien la banda no estaba de acuerdo, sigui trabajando con el productor sabiendo de antemano que esta sera su ltima colaboracin.
Los desacuerdos entre los msicos y Dierks atras todo el proceso, as que su grabacin tom alrededor de dos aos y medio. Algunos de los msicos no quedaron conformes con la tecnologa empleada, porque consideraron que el lbum sonaba rgido. A su vez, el acercamiento hacia el  glam metal  se reflej en el estilo de composicin, puesto que las canciones estaban llenas de clichs y msica forzada. Una vez que sali al mercado, recibi reseas mixtas por parte de la crtica especializada; algunos medios lo destacaron como una buena continuacin de  Love at First Sting , mientras que otros lo consideraron una decepcin y sobreproducido, pero con algunos buenos momentos. A pesar de aquello, logr buenas posiciones en las listas musicales de varios pases: por ejemplo, entr entre los diez lbumes ms vendidos en los recuentos de  Alemania ,  Estados Unidos ,  Noruega ,  Suecia  y  Suiza , mientras que en  Finlandia  lleg hasta el primer lugar. Asimismo, recibi varias  certificaciones  de disco de oro y platino.

Tras finalizar la gira  True Colors World Tour , Lauper recibi la propuesta de protagonizar la  comedia romntica   Vibes , para la que grab el tema  Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China) .

"Welcome to GMPG 
Global Multimedia Protocols Group 
The GMPG can be explained as an experiment in Metamemetics. The first aim of Metamemetics is to create a structure of principles that foster the construction and propagation of elemental ideas.  The GMPG attempts to stimulate simplification of virtual substructures and bring people to question established structures and their relationships.  Because people are not used to seeing elemental technologies or concepts which are powerful and immediately usable, frequent and novel encounters with GMPG efforts provoke optimism and empowerment, nevertheless reawakening criticism of complexity and a desire for simplicity.
Efforts

We would like to express our gratitude to Peter and plumbers from Clementi Town Council. We have a very serious piping leakage issue (due to choke) at our balcony. Peter and his team responded to our issue in a short period of time. He diligently followed up closely with us, neighbours and James from HDB to solve this problem. 
Please pass on our profound thanks to Peter and team. 
Best regards, Lee Pui Shun 
Hi, I am heartened by JRTCs recent efforts in addressing my concerns over 
1) recalcitrant spitter and required clean-up; and 2) billowing smoke from open face burning wafting into my freshly laundered clothes on bamboo pole. Hence, I am writing in to thank the team, and in particular Lazarus for 1) his dedicated service, 2) prompt response despite after hours and 3) thorough follow-up. Appreciate Lazarus and the teams efforts especially in this trying period where undoubtedly, COVID-19 has stretched your manpower resources due to required extensive cleaning schedules. Thank you so much ! 
Lam Yiling 
Dear Mr Tham, 
I would like to compliment Mr. Leong and his team for their prompt response in handling by my feedback. On 15 Jan morning, I showed the place that I had fell, which is full of algae on the slope and the staircase. 
On 16 Jan, Mr Leong had arranged the workers to lay the anti-slip solution on the mentioned area. Thank for the prompt follow up from the team. 
Cheers! 
Lai Chan Fook 
Dear MP Dr Tan Wu Meng, 
I am a resident of block 441b. I raised two issues on behalf of some residents viz. cockroaches running around and repaint of walls facing doors from black to white. 
All these have now been solved. We appreciate the excellent work rendered by your town council staff in particular Ms Valerie. 
Please convey our appreciation to them. We are happy residents of Clementi

By Indicator 
Globally, 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions emanate from cities. At the same time, cities are being hit increasingly by climate change related shocks and stresses, ranging from more frequent extreme weather events to inflows of climate migrants. A new World Bank report provides policymakers with a compass for designing tailored policies that can help cities and countries take effective action to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  Learn more. 
Globally, roughly half of working age women participate in the labor force, which is significantly lower than the male labor force participation rate of around 80%.This gap is virtually unchanged from what it was three decades ago. And there are sizeable differences in the level of female labor force participation across regions.Moreover, women tend to face inferior income opportunities and on average earn less than men.Explore more aspects of female labor force participation through this data story .

Get Started Attend free classes for beginners Get access to classes with Hootsuite experts who will show you the ropes and answer all your social media management questions (even the ones your boss is too shy to ask). Learn More Ow.ly Frequently Asked Questions What is Ow.ly? Ow.ly is Hootsuites very own URL shortener. It allows you to shorten links for free as you compose and plan posts in the dashboard. Each link can be customized with tracking parameters to monitor success using analytics tools. What is the best URL shortener? Were partial to Ow.ly, of course, but there are plenty of top-notch link shorteners out there. Weve put together a guide to all the best URL shorteners to help you decide which one is best for you. Where is Ow.ly in Hootsuite? Ow.ly is found in the Hootsuite Composer. When you add a link into the content box of Composer, Hootsuite will automatically give you the option to shorten with Ow.ly and add tracking parameters. Is it easy to use Ow.ly in Hootsuite? Yes. The Hootsuite dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, so shortening links and tracking clicks is a cinch. Are there any other benefits to using Hootsuite? Lots! Hootsuite is the most popular social media management platform on earth and lets you manage all your social accounts in one place, schedule messages in advance, track important conversations, and, of course, use the Ow.ly link shortener. Why shorten URLs? Shortening lengthy URLs with a tool like the Ow.ly link shortener can help you create neater links and measure how many clicks they get. Short links are useful if youre working with a limited character count and dont want to waste precious caption space on a never-ending URL. For example, Ow.ly is the perfect Twitter URL shortener because it leaves more of those 280 characters for your actual message. Long links look spammy and untrustworthy, so people are less likely to click on them. Plus, vanity URLs can help boost brand awareness and keep your business top-of-mind. Can you create custom URLs with Ow.ly? Yes, you can create custom links with Ow.ly as long as you have a Team plan or above. Create a vanity URL in Hootsuite by navigating to Account & Settings and then selecting Vanity URLs. Why do I need a Hootsuite account to use Ow.ly? Previously, Ow.ly was available to everyone. However, to increase security for our users, weve moved the Ow.ly link shortener into the Hootsuite dashboard. To access it,  sign up for your free Hootsuite trial here .

Market value of the largest internet companies worldwide 2023
As of August 2023, Alphabet was the biggest internet company worldwide with a market cap of over 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars Second-ranked Amazon had a market capitalization of 1,373 billion U.S. dollars. 
The end of the 1990s in the United States saw the rise of a great number of internet companies, also called online companies or a variety of the name dot com, where the .com domain is derived from the word commercial. At the time, such  startups  were merely riding the wave of early internet business, but had little capital and perhaps one good idea. Few companies have survived the burst of the dot com bubble and even fewer have managed to become internationally successful.  A few notable exceptions are American companies such as Google (founded in 1998),  Amazon  (founded in 1994) or  eBay Inc.  (founded in 1995), and the Chinese online giant  Alibaba  (founded in 1998), which have come to be some of the largest internet companies in the world.
Topping the ranking of largest internet companies worldwide is currently  Alphabet, the parent company of Google , with a market capitalization of 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars as of April 2023. Having started as a PhD project at Stanford University, the Google project slowly gained traction and is now the  number one search engine in the world , with a market share of 86 percent on the search engine market. Due to a number of high profile acquisitions, Google has expanded its portfolio beyond search, to include the video content sharing site YouTube, the digital app platform Google Play Store, the webmail service Gmail and the web browser Google Chrome, to only name a few. As of February 2023, it is also the  most visited multi-platform website in the United States , with almost 274 million U.S. unique visitors during that month alone. In October 2015, Google reorganized itself into a newly created parent company, the multinational conglomerate Alphabet Inc.
The biggest internet companies in terms of their  workforce  are currently Amazon, Alphabet and Meta.

X (formerly Twitter) accounts with the most followers worldwide 2023
As of August 2023, X (formerly Twitter) CEO Elon Musk was the most followed person on the platform, with little over 140 million followers. Additionally, former U.S. President Barack Obama amassed 132 million followers on the micro-blogging service. In April 2023, Musk changed Twitter's legal name to X Corp.
Celebrities and Twitter
Founded in 2006 as Twitter, X is an online social networking and microblogging service that allows users to post text-based status updates and messages of up to 280 characters in length. As of the fourth quarter of 2020,  X had 192 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU) worldwide .
X provides a near-instant access channel to celebrities. The majority of the top ten most-followed X accounts are entertainers who use the medium to communicate with fans, spread relevant news regarding their work or work on their public image. The near-instant gratification through a stream of direct updates from celebrities or personalities as well as the feeling of belonging to a particular group of fans is a popular reason for social media users to use X. In order to establish authenticity of identity on X, accounts of people from high-interest areas such as music, fashion, entertainment, politics, media, business or other areas as well as individuals at high risk of impersonation are verified by X. The verification badge symbolizes that the account is maintained by a legitimate source.
Major sporting events and industry award shows such as the Super Bowl, the Grammy Awards or Academy Awards generate lots of  online buzz on X . The online discussion allows users to participate in the success of celebrities who often post behind-the-scenes photo tweets or commentaries. On-set or in-concert tweets are further methods of celebrities enhancing their appeal, and level of fan interaction.

Spotify ad revenue 2017-2027
Spotify generated an estimated 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in advertising revenue in 2022. Based on the latest calculations, this figure will reach 2.2 billion U.S. dollars by 2027. 
Why advertise on Spotify?
One of the main reasons for Spotify's appeal as an advertising destination is its reach. Company reports indicated that the  number of Spotify's monthly active users (MAUs)  hit a record high of 433 million in 2022, nearly twice the audience size recorded in 2019. By comparison, Apple Music has yet to reach the 100-million-subscriber mark, highlighting Spotify's pole position among the world's most popular paid music streaming services. Another factor distinguishing the Swedish streaming giant from international competitors is its two-tier subscription model. In addition to its Premium model, Spotify offers a free, ad-supported option that serves audio and video ads between songs. 
Spotlight on podcast advertising
Podcasts have become essential contributors to the success of digital audio streaming platforms like  Spotify . Data showed that Spotify amassed over 32 million monthly podcast listeners in the United States in 2022 and outperformed Apple Podcasts by some four million listeners. Not only that, but  Spotify's podcast advertising revenue  has also skyrocketed in recent years, jumping from just over 25 million in 2020 to almost 192 million in 2022. Industry sources expect this figure to surpass 400 million by the year 2024, highlighting the ever-increasing contribution of podcast content to Spotify's financial future.

Goodbye Google Webmasters, hello Google Search Central
Wednesday, November 11, 2020
The history behind Google Webmasters 
Merriam-Webster claims  the first known use of the word ""webmaster"" was in 1993, years before Google even existed. However, the term is becoming archaic, and according to the  data found in books , its use is in sharp decline. A user experience study we ran revealed that very few web professionals identify themselves as webmasters anymore. They're more likely to call themselves Search Engine Optimizer (SEO), online marketer, blogger, web developer, or site owner, but very few ""webmasters"". 
We're changing our name 
In brainstorming our new name, we realized that there's not one term that perfectly summarizes the work people do on websites. To focus more on the topic that we talk about (Google Search), we're changing our name from ""Google Webmasters Central"" to ""Google Search Central"", both on our websites and on social media. Our goal is still the same; we aim to help people improve the visibility of their website on Google Search.The change will happen on most platforms in the next couple days. 
Centralizing help information to one site 
To help people learn how to improve their website's visibility on Google Search, we're also consolidating our help documentation and blogs to one site. 
Moving forward, the  Search Console Help Center  will contain only documentation related to using Search Console. It's also still the home of our help forum, newly renamed from ""Webmasters Help Community"" to "" Google Search Central Community "". The information related to how Google Search works, crawling and indexing, Search guidelines, and other Search-related topics are moving to  our new site , which previously focused only on web developer documentation. The content move will happen over the next few days.
We will continue to create content for anyone who wants their websites to show up on Google Search, whether you're just getting started with SEO or you're an experienced web professional.
Consolidating the blogs 
The blog that you're reading right now is also moving to our main site. However, we will wait one week to allow subscribers to read this last post on the old platform. Moving this blog, including our other 13 localized blogs, to one place brings the following benefits:
More discovery of related content (help documentation, localized blogs, event information, on one site)
Easier to switch between languages (no longer have to find the localized blog URL)
Better platform allows us to maintain content, localize blog post more easily, and format posts consistently 
Going forward, all archived and new blog posts will appear on  https://developers.google.com/search/blog . You don't need to take any action in order to keep getting updates from us; we will redirect the current set of RSS and email subscribers to the new blog URL. 
Googlebot mascot gets a refresh 
Our Googlebot mascot is also getting an upgrade. Googlebot's days of wandering the web solo come to a close as a new sidekick joins Googlebot in crawling the internet. 
When we first met this curious critter, we wondered, ""Is it really a spider?"" After some observation, we noticed this spider bot hybrid can jump great distances and sees best when surrounded by green light. We think Googlebot's new best friend is a spider from the genus  Phidippus , though it seems to also have bot-like characteristics. Googlebot's been trying out new nicknames for the little spider bot, but they haven't settled on anything yet. Maybe you can help? 
As parting words, update your bookmarks and if you have any questions or comments, you can find us on  Twitter  and in our  Google Search Central Help Community .

Timing for bringing page experience to Google Search
Tuesday, November 10, 2020
This past May , we announced that  page experience  signals would be included in Google Search ranking. These signals measure how users perceive the experience of interacting with a web page and contribute to our ongoing work to ensure people get the most helpful and enjoyable experiences from the web. In the past several months, weve seen a median 70% increase in the number of users  engaging with Lighthouse and Page Speed Insights, and many site owners using Search Consoles Core Web Vitals report to identify opportunities for improvement.
Today were announcing that the page experience signals in ranking will roll out in May 2021. The new page experience signals combine Core Web Vitals with our existing search signals including  mobile-friendliness ,  safe-browsing ,  HTTPS-security , and  intrusive interstitial guidelines .
The change for non-AMP content to become eligible to appear in the mobile Top Stories feature in Search will also roll out in May 2021. Any page that meets the  Google News content policies  will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results. 
In addition to the timing updates described above, we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience.
A New Way of Highlighting Great Experiences in Google Search 
We believe that providing information about the quality of a web pages experience can be helpful to users in choosing the search result that they want to visit. On results, the snippet or image preview helps provide topical context for users to know what information a page can provide. Visual indicators on the results are another way to do the same, and we are working on one that identifies pages that have met all of the page experience criteria. We plan to test this soon and if the testing is successful, it will launch in May 2021 and well share more details on the progress of this in the coming months.
The Tools Publishers Need for Improving Page Experience  
To get ready for these changes, we have released a variety of tools that publishers can use to start improving their page experience. The first step is doing a site-wide audit of your pages to see where there is room for improvement. Search Consoles  report  for Core Web Vitals gives you an overview of how your site is doing and a deepdive into issues. Once youve identified opportunities,  Page Speed Insights  and  Lighthouse  can help you as you iterate on fixing any issues that youve uncovered. Head over to  web.dev/vitals-tools  for a roundup of all the tools you need to get started.
Additionally, AMP is  one of the easiest and cost-effective ways  for publishers looking to achieve great page experience outcomes. Based on the  analysis  that the AMP team has done, the majority of the AMP pages achieve great page experiences. If youre an AMP publisher, check out the recently launched  AMP Page Experience Guide , a diagnostic tool that provides developers with actionable advice. 
We continue to support AMP content in Google Search. If you publish an AMP version of your content, Google Search will link to that cache-optimized AMP version to help optimize delivery to users, just as is the case today.
Conclusion 
At Google Search our mission is to help users find the most relevant and quality sites on the web. The goal with these updates is to highlight the best experiences and ensure that users can find the information theyre looking for. Our work is ongoing, which is why we plan to incorporate more page experience signals going forward and update them on a yearly basis. We hope that the  tools and resources  weve provided make it easier for you to create great websites, and thereby build a web ecosystem that users love.

PES@Home 2020: Googles first virtual summit for Product Experts
Thursday, November 05, 2020
More than ever, users are relying on Google products to do their jobs, educate their kids, and stay in touch with loved ones. Our  Google Product Experts  (PEs) play a vital role in supporting these users in community forums, like the  Webmaster Help Community , across many languages.
For several years now, we have been inviting our most advanced PEs from around the world to a bi-annual, 3-day PE Summit. These events provide an opportunity not only to share latest product updates with PEs, but also to acknowledge and celebrate their tireless contributions to help our users. As the world was going into lockdown in March, we quickly decided that we dont want to miss out on this annual celebration. So the summit team shifted focus and started planning an all virtual event which came to be called PES@Home. 
Through the house-themed virtual event platform, PEs participated in over 120 sessions in the ""office"", got a chance to engage with each other and Googlers in the ""kitchen"", had fun on the ""rooftop"" learning more about magic or mixology, and - hopefully - came out feeling reconnected and re-energized. In addition to a large number of general talks, Webmaster PEs were able to attend and ask questions during eight product specific breakout sessions with Search product managers and engineers, which covered topics like page experience, Web Stories, crawling, Image Search, and free shopping listings. 
We are truly overwhelmed and grateful for how Webmaster PEs continue to grow the community, connection, and engagement in such a strange time. As a testament to the helpful spirit in the Webmaster community, we were thrilled to present the ""Silver Lining Award"" for someone who demonstrates a sense of humour and emphasizes the positive side of every situation to one of our own Webmaster PEs.
In the name of all the countless people asking product questions in the forums, we'd like to express our thanks to the patient, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly Webmaster Product Experts, who help to make the web shine when it comes to presence on Search.
If you want to read more about the summit, check out this summary from a  Webmaster PE point of view .

Best practices for Black Friday and Cyber Monday pages
Monday, October 26, 2020
The end of the year holiday season is a peak time for many merchants with special sales events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As a merchant, you can help Google highlight your sales events by providing landing pages with relevant content and high quality images.
Best Practices 
The following are recommended best practices for your landing pages:
Create the page early.  Make sure you create the page well before the sale so Googlebot has time to discover and index the page. Make sure you are not blocking Google from crawling the URL (the Google  URL Inspection Tool  can be used to check this).
Follow standard SEO best practices.  A list of SEO best practices for landing pages can be found in our  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide .
Link to the landing pages from your home page  (or similar) to increase their prominence, helping users (and Google) find the landing page quicker.
Use a recurring URL , not a new URL for each occurrence of the event. Give the landing page of recurring events a meaningful URL that reflects the event that is used each year (for example: use /sale/black-friday, not /sale/2020/black-friday).
Include a relevant, high quality image.  Provide a static image with an up-to-date representation of your sale. Trim any whitespace around the borders of the image, and ensure that the image is visually engaging and is of good quality. For additional guidance on image quality, review the  Google Images best practices  and  Images Web Fundamentals .
Get your page recrawled.  After you've tested your structured data for validity,  ask Google to recrawl your page  to get your content updated more quickly. (Note: as of publication this tool is undergoing maintenance, but we hope to have it up-and-running again soon.) 
If you have any questions, let us know through the  Help forum  or on  Twitter .

The Search Console Training lives on
Friday, October 02, 2020
In November 2019 we announced the  Search Console Training  YouTube series and started publishing videos regularly. The goal of the series was to create updated video content to be used alongside Search documentation, for example in the  Help Center  and in the  Developers site . 
The wonderful Google Developer Studio team (the engine behind those videos!) put together this fun blooper reel for the first wave of videos that we recorded in the Google London studio. 
So far weve published twelve episodes in the series, each focusing on a different part of the tool. Weve seen its helping lots of people to learn how to use Search Console - so  we decided to continue recording videos at home!  Please bear with the trucks, ambulances, neighbors, passing clouds, and of course the doorbell. \_()_/ 
In addition to the location change, were also changing the scope of the new videos. Instead of focusing on one report at a time, well discuss how Search Console can help YOUR business. In each episode well focus on types of website, like ecommerce, and job roles, like developers. 
To hear about new videos as soon as they're published,  subscribe to our YouTube channel , and feel free to leave feedback  on Twitter . 
Stay tuned!

New Schema.org support for retailer shipping data
Tuesday, September 22, 2020
Quick summary : Starting today, we support  shippingDetails  schema.org markup  as an alternative way for retailers to be eligible for shipping details in Google Search results. 
Since June 2020, retailers have been able to list their products across different Google surfaces for free,  including on Google Search . We are committed to supporting ways for the ecosystem to better connect with users that come to Google to look for the best products, brands, and retailers by investing both in more robust tooling in  Google Merchant Center  as well as with new kinds of schema.org options. 
Shipping details, including cost and expected delivery times, are often a key consideration for users making purchase decisions. In our own studies, weve heard that users abandon shopping checkouts because of unforeseen or uncertain shipping costs. This is why we will often show shipping cost information in certain result types, including on free listings on Google Search (currently in the US, in English only). 
Retailers have always been able to  configure shipping settings in Google Merchant Center  in order to display this information in listings. Starting today, we now also support the  shippingDetails  schema.org markup  type for retailers who don't have active Merchant Center accounts with product feeds.
For retailers that are interested in this new markup, check out  our documentation  to get started.

In the Media
The Boston Globe        
Prof. Carlo Ratti co-authors an article for The Boston Globe that examines the power and pitfalls of condensing cities into small, specialized utopias, like Barbie Land and Los Alamos. To see diversity at work, we need look no further than Barbenheimer itself, they write. This accidental double feature turned our empty movie theaters into pop-up cities, tiny but diverse, with two tentpole films like adjacent storefronts on the street.

The Economist        
A new working paper, co-authored by Prof. Jonathan Gruber, explores the impact of the New Co-operative Medical Scheme (NCMS), a health-insurance plan for rural Chinese that was launched in 2003 and folded into a more comprehensive program in 2013, reports  The Economist . Though it is perhaps best known for being stingy, the NCMS saved millions of lives, writes  The Economist.

National Geographic        
In a new MIT study, researchers found that people were less likely to order a menu item when it was specifically labeled as ""vegan"" compared to when it was not, reports Meryl Davids Landau for  National Geographic . The research is not trying to tell anyone they need to strictly transition into these diets in order to make an impact, says graduate student Alex Berke. This is about people eating more sustainably, more often, and what can we do to guide people towards those practices.

WCVB        
Graduate student Turga Ganapathy is studying the best ways to grow spirulina at home so that the microalgae can be used as a food source, reports WCVB-TV. Spirulina are complete proteins, meaning that they produce amino acids that the human body cannot synthesize that we usually get from animals or a combination of different plant-based proteins, says Ganapathy.

Financial Times        
Researchers at MIT and elsewhere have used artificial intelligence to develop a new antibiotic to combat  Acinetobacter baumannii , a challenging bacteria known to become resistant to antibiotics, reports Hannah Kuchler for the  Financial Times . It took just an hour and a half  a long lunch  for the AI to serve up a potential new antibiotic, an offering to a world contending with the rise of so-called superbugs: bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that have mutated and no longer respond to the drugs we have available, writes Kuchler.

The Boston Globe        
Prof. Jessika Trancik speaks with  Boston Globe  reporter Aruni Soni about her new study that finds reducing the cost of solar energy will be accelerated by   improvements in soft tech. We found that the soft technology involved in solar energy really has not changed and hasnt improved nearly as quickly as the hardware, says Trancik. These soft costs, in many systems, can be 50 percent or even more of the total cost of solar electricity.

Boston Magazine        
Prof. Jinhua Zhao writes for  Boston Magazine  about how artificial intelligence could help improve the MBTA system.  When something significant happens on public transportationthe line is down, the road is congested, some bridge is blockedthe customer is suddenly stuck in the system and needs more help,  writes Zhao. For when that happens, we developed a solution to send individualized guidance for a better transit option to that person, communicated by text message or an app.

Popular Science        
Using techniques inspired by kirigami, a Japanese paper-cutting technique, MIT researchers have developed a a novel method to manufacture plate lattices  high performance materials useful in automotive and aerospace designs, reports Andrew Paul for  Popular Science .  The kirigami-augmented plate lattices withstood three times as much force as standard aluminum corrugation designs, writes Paul. Such variations show immense promise for lightweight, shock-absorbing sections needed within cars, planes, and spacecraft.""

Gus Solomons Jr. 61, a leading figure in modern and postmodern dance, has died at 84, reports Gia Kourlas for  The New York Times . Solomons began dancing at age 4, but didnt begin training until he was a first year student at MIT, where he earned a degree in architecture.

Astronomical observations, such as the rotation of galaxies and their relative velocities in galaxy clusters, have provided compelling evidence that the universe contains much more matter than is visible in stars. Although this so-called dark matter is thought to be as much as ten times larger than the visible kind, its nature is still a mystery.

Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings,
including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover
entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can
easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use
Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages.
Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others
already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.
Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex,
Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open  community  process,
using the  public-schemaorg@w3.org 
mailing list and through  GitHub .
A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide
on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.
It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the
larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.

Artikel des Tages 
Als  Wobbler-Syndrom  (Syn.  Zervikale Malformation ,  Zervikale Spondylopathie ,  Zervikale Spondylomyelopathie ,  Spinale Ataxie ) wird in der Tiermedizin ein Symptomkomplex bezeichnet, der durch Nervenschdigungen im Bereich des Rckenmarks bzw. der Rckenmarksnerven im Bereich der Halswirbelsule hervorgerufen wird  (spinale Ataxie) . Der Begriff leitet sich vom unsicheren (ataktischen) Bewegungsablauf des erkrankten Tieres ab: Wobbler kommt vom altdeutschen Wort wobbeln (wackeln, engl.  to wobble ). Das Wobbler-Syndrom tritt vor allem bei Pferden und Hunden auf, als Ursache kommt eine Vielzahl unterschiedlicher Erkrankungen in Frage. Der Heilungserfolg hngt von der eigentlichen Ursache ab, einige Krankheiten haben eine gute, andere eine schlechte Prognose. Die Symptome werden durch eine Schdigung des Halsmarks erzeugt, im Regelfall durch eine Kompression, bei Pferden selten auch durch eine Infektion. Das Krankheitsbild entspricht damit der zervikalen Spinalkanalstenose des Menschen. Die Kompression kann durch eine statische Verengung des Wirbelkanals zustande kommen ( statischer  Wobbler). Ein  dynamischer  Wobbler liegt vor, wenn das Rckenmark erst infolge einer Bewegung komprimiert wird.  Zum Artikel

The Onions Are Ready! 
One of the best things about this time of year is harvesting so many great crops in the garden - this week we have lots of beautiful farm-grown onions and shallots. 
The onion, Allium cepa, is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. Onions are hardy, easy to grow, and can be grown in a variety of soils and climates. We plant a lot of onions every year. I use them in my cooking, and in sandwiches and salads. I also share many of them with my daughter, Alexis, and my grandchildren, Jude and Truman. Earlier this week, my gardener, Ryan McCallister, picked the onions from my new garden here at the farm and they are truly some of the best we've ever grown. 
Enjoy these photos. 
Such a bounty of gorgeous fresh onions  its one of our favorite crops to pick.
Here at the farm, our onions are started from seed in the greenhouse and then planted outdoors in the garden bed.
Here is what one of our onion plants looked like in late April just before planting it in the ground.
This year, we planted two large beds for red onions, white onions, yellow and brown onions.
And here they are in May  just one month after planting. The onion, Allium cepa, is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. They are planted in spring when temperatures are still a bit cool. Early planting gives the onions time to develop tops and store energy for the bulbs.
In June, the plants are much more developed and the leaves are quite tall, bright green, and sturdy.
By July, the onions are starting to show through the soil, but they are still small and the top leaves are still very green.
Looking down, this is one of the growing onions.
Onions require 90 to 100 days to mature from seed, which is around four months. From sets, onions are ready to harvest after around 80 days, or just under three months. We picked a few onions for my summer vacation in Maine. 
This week, the tops of the onion plants have fallen over naturally  an indication they are fully mature and ready to harvest. 
Here, the onion leaves are also quite brown and dry. This happens at the neck of the onion, where the leaves meet the bulb, and signals that the plant has stopped growing.
Heres Ryan after picking one of our largest onions. To pick, he carefully loosens the surrounding soil and then gently pulls the onion up by its top. Its important to keep the stem intact to prevent the possibility of rot.
All these onions are in great condition. Ryan also keeps track of the varieties that grew well, so we know what kinds to grow again next season.
The red onions were also picked.
As well as the shallots. Shallots, Allium ascalonicum, are a member of the allium family, closely related to onions, garlic, and chives.
Shallots are smaller than onions, their skin is papery and coppery-pink, the flesh is pale purple and white, and the bulbs grow in clusters, similar to cloves of garlic.
Once all the onions and shallots are picked, Ryan brings them into the hoop house closest to my main greenhouse where they can cure. Curing is a process of preparing the onions for long-term storage. During the curing stage, the outer layers of the onions dry out, tightening around the bulb and creating a protective layer that keeps the onion firm and fresh for a longer time.
Some of the red onions had already been curing for a couple of weeks. Ryan removes the top layer of skin from the onion and clips the tops and roots. 
The shiny skin should remain. He also lightly brushes off any loose soil before placing in a single layer on the shelf where they can continue to cure.
The onions need plenty of space for air to circulate, and can even be turned occasionally to make sure they dry evenly. Our greenhouse shelves are metal and have air circulating through, so this environment is Ideal. It is also warm in this hoop house  75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, dry, and out of the sun. 
Ryan is careful when handling the onions, so they dont bruise. 
When cured and stored properly, a good storage onion will retain its eating quality for 10 to 12 months. I cant wait to try them. How did your onions do this year?

Growing Mushrooms 
Whenever I go hiking at Skylands, my home in Maine, or in the woodlands of my Bedford, New York farm, I always enjoy discovering and identifying all the different types of wild mushrooms that may be growing along the way. 
A mushroom is the fleshy spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus. Fungus thrives in moist areas and loves growing on decaying wood. While many may try to eradicate mushrooms from their lawns, they are an important part of the forest ecosystem. Because they live off of decaying plant matter, fungus breaks down and disposes of fallen tree branches, leaves, and even animals. It also digests rock particles and other organic matter in the soil, so new plants can grow. Earlier this year, I received mushroom growing kits from  2FUNGUYS  - an Atlanta, Georgia company that sells mushroom growing spawn plugs, inoculated logs, and complete starter growing kits. The process of growing mushrooms is very interesting, and very different from growing other crops, so I decided to grow some here at the farm. 
Enjoy these photos andremember, never eat any mushroom you cannot clearly identify. 
One way to grow ones own mushrooms is to inoculate logs with mushroom plugs. Last March, Pete from my outdoor grounds crew went into the woodland for just the right trees. I hate to take down any trees, but he only looked for those that were growing too close to other more robust trees, those that were not growing well, or trees that were broken and needed to be removed. The best kind of wood to use for mushrooms is deciduous hardwood, such as oak, beech, willow, birch, elm, and poplar.
The logs used should also be the right size  four to 10 inches in diameter 
and about two to five feet long. Pete cut them all to the same size.
The best time to cut the fresh logs is during the fall or winter, when their leaves have fallen and their sugar concentration is highest. After they are cut, they are left to rest for a few weeks.
The logs are then brought to an area tucked behind some trees and stacked securely for mushroom growing. Its important that the logs used are clean and free of rot. These are stacked in a loose crib formation.
Some of the logs were also planted upright, another way to stack logs for mushrooms. Pete is digging the hole for the upright logs. Logs can also be stacked in a loose lean-to or upright A-frame structure.
Pete dug holes for six upright logs. 
Here is our mushroom garden. On average, a mushroom log will produce for one year per inch of diameter of the log. Hopefully these will be very productive.
Our mushroom spawn plugs came in kits  one for oyster mushrooms, Pleurotus ostreatus, one of the more commonly sought wild mushrooms; lions mane mushrooms, Hericium erinaceus, those big, white mushrooms from the tooth fungus family that grow on woody tree trunks; and, shiitake mushrooms, Lentinus edodes, another popular mushroom renowned for its unique and savory flavor.
Each kit contains a hundred mushroom spawn plugs, an appropriate sized drill bit, tags, daubers, wax, and a complete instruction card.
Ryan starts by melting the wax. The wax will be used for sealing the plug into the log.
Once it is melted down, it is brought to the mushroom log site.
Meanwhile, Brian drills the holes in the logs. Using a 5/16-inch bit, he drills holes two-inches from one end of the log, spacing them several inches apart until he has reached the opposite end.
He does this on all the upright logs as well as those positioned horizontally.
This is what the log looks like after it is drilled  holes are around the entire girth of each log.
The holes should be about an inch and a quarter deep  deep enough for the mushroom plug to fit flush inside the hole.
These are organic mushroom plugs  each filled with pure mushroom mycelium.
Ryan takes each plug and inserts it into the hole and using a mallet, taps it until the plug is flush.
The plug should be very snug.
Next, using the dauber dipped into the melted wax, Ryan dabs the plug until it is completely covered and sealed. 
This is a well covered spawn plug. It is important to make sure the inoculated logs are also well-watered twice per week to maintain the moisture levels. Mycelium are living organisms, so if the logs completely dry out, the mycelium will die. Our log stacks will be kept uncovered, where they are exposed and have access to rainwater.
Here is a log all done. We should have our first fruiting in about nine to 12 months  I cant wait. If youre looking for a wonderful family project, consider growing mushrooms. And go to the  2FUNGUYS.com  for more information.

The Sunflowers are Blooming 
Here at the farm, the sunflowers are in bloom with their big daisy-like faces and brightly colored petals - it's always a very welcomed sight. 
If you recall, my head gardener, Ryan McCallister, planted our sunflowers, Helianthus, in late June. They were planted in the center bed of my new vegetable garden. Sunflowers are the popular and cheerful annuals whose giant, round flower heads look like the sun. They come in vibrant yellow, but they're also seen in various shades of orange, red, bronze, and even white. 
Enjoy these photos. 
In late June, when we were still planting our first crops in the new vegetable garden, Ryan and I decided it would be nice to plant the sunflowers in this long center bed. We knew they would grow excellently here, but also provide a lovely selection of giant flowers for all to see. 
For planting the large sunflower seeds, Ryan used this  rolling dibbler  available at Johnnys Selected Seeds. It comes in single form like this one or with multiple wheels. It allows one to create evenly spaced impressions in the soil for accurate transplanting.
Ryan planted a variety of sunflowers from our favorite sunflower vendors, including  Johnnys Selected Seeds ,  Bear Creek Farm , and  Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds .
He also planted some from  Sunflower Steve Seed Co. 
Sunflower seeds are normally black with white stripes and approximately five eighths of an inch long. The heavy hull accounts for approximately half the weight of the seed and is loosely fixed around the kernel inside.
Ryan planted one seed into each hole. Sunflowers grow quickly. Many can grow 12 feet in only three months. With the proper growing conditions, sunflowers should reach maturity in 70 to 100 days after planting.
Here is one just beginning to open.
And now, many of the flowers are in full bloom. Sunflowers commonly bloom during summer and a portion of fall. 
Young sunflowers turn to face the sun as it moves across the sky. They face east at dawn and then slowly turn west as the sun moves. During the night, they slowly turn back east to begin the cycle again. This is known as heliotropism and is due to the presence of auxin, a growth hormone in the stem. This process continues until the sunflower is mature.
Sunflower is the only flower with flower in its name. Helia for sun and anthus for flower. Sunflowers are also the symbol of faith, loyalty and adoration. Sunflowers have different colored petals, but their centers also vary in different shades. The center of this sunflower is a light colored yellow and green.
Sunflowers are among the most popular of annuals. They have grown even more popular in the last couple of years because of the support for Ukraine. The sunflower is Ukraines national flower. It is also the state flower of Kansas here in the US.
We planted many classic yellow sunflowers as well as the more unusual bronze to red colored sunflowers. All of them look so pretty in the garden.
This bright yellow sunflower has long thin petals and a smaller center than other varieties. 
Sunflowers produce a huge amount of pollen and nectar making so many pollinators very happy. Pollen from sunflowers has been found to boost the immune systems of both bumbles bees and honey bees.
Each sunflower is actually thousands of tiny flowers. The center of the sunflower is filled with disc florets, the flowers in the middle that contain male and female reproductive organs and mature into fruit and seed. 
Around the disc florets are the ray florets or the sterile florets on the outside. Each sunflower can contain as many as 1,000 to 2,000 seeds.
The sunflowers leaves are large, arranged alternately along the stem when mature. They have serrated margins, and are triangular to heart-shaped and can grow up to 12 inches in length.
A common sunflower stem is sturdy and covered in coarse hairs. Sunflowers also have long tap roots that need to stretch out, so the plants prefer well-dug, loose, well-draining soil.
Here are three mature sunflowers all facing east. They often face the rising sun because increased morning warmth attracts more bees and helps the plants reproduce more efficiently. 
Tall sunflower varieties can usually grow up to 15 feet tall. The height of a sunflowers depends on its variety. Some dwarf sunflowers only grow to be about three feet tall and the tallest recorded sunflower was more than 30 feet.
One can plant annual sunflowers in almost every plant hardiness zone as long as it is in full sun. Sunflowers usually stay in bloom for about three weeks, sometimes even four. In this garden, with its nutrient-rich soil, Im hoping these pretty flowers last even longer well see.

Webmaster Central Blog
Official news on crawling and indexing sites for the Google index
We moved! Introducing the new home for the Google Webmaster Blogs
Thursday, November 19, 2020
Last week we  changed our name to Google Search Central  and published our new central site. As part of this site migration, we're also consolidating the Google Webmaster Blogs into one place on the new site.
Today, we're announcing that  this page within the Google Search Central site  is the new home for our blog. We migrated all of the archived blog posts,  dating back to 2005 . They're available in the archive drop down menu.
No action required for your subscribtion 
You don't need to take any action in order to keep getting updates from us. We will redirect the current set of RSS and email subscribers to the new blog URL.
Translations are coming soon 
We're still working on moving translated blog posts, so it may take some time until you see translated content appearing on the blog. When posts are translated, you'll be able to select your language on this site and get the translated content, compared to the previous blog setup where you needed to know the URL.
If you have any questions or comments, you can find us on  Twitter  and in our  Google Search Central Help Community .

Goodbye Google Webmasters, hello Google Search Central
Wednesday, November 11, 2020
The history behind Google Webmasters 
Merriam-Webster claims  the first known use of the word ""webmaster"" was in 1993, years before Google even existed. However, the term is becoming archaic, and according to the  data found in books , its use is in sharp decline. A user experience study we ran revealed that very few web professionals identify themselves as webmasters anymore. They're more likely to call themselves Search Engine Optimizer (SEO), online marketer, blogger, web developer, or site owner, but very few ""webmasters"". 
We're changing our name 
In brainstorming our new name, we realized that there's not one term that perfectly summarizes the work people do on websites. To focus more on the topic that we talk about (Google Search), we're changing our name from ""Google Webmasters Central"" to ""Google Search Central"", both on our websites and on social media. Our goal is still the same; we aim to help people improve the visibility of their website on Google Search.The change will happen on most platforms in the next couple days. 
Centralizing help information to one site 
To help people learn how to improve their website's visibility on Google Search, we're also consolidating our help documentation and blogs to one site. 
Moving forward, the  Search Console Help Center  will contain only documentation related to using Search Console. It's also still the home of our help forum, newly renamed from ""Webmasters Help Community"" to "" Google Search Central Community "". The information related to how Google Search works, crawling and indexing, Search guidelines, and other Search-related topics are moving to  our new site , which previously focused only on web developer documentation. The content move will happen over the next few days.
We will continue to create content for anyone who wants their websites to show up on Google Search, whether you're just getting started with SEO or you're an experienced web professional.
Consolidating the blogs 
The blog that you're reading right now is also moving to our main site. However, we will wait one week to allow subscribers to read this last post on the old platform. Moving this blog, including our other 13 localized blogs, to one place brings the following benefits:
More discovery of related content (help documentation, localized blogs, event information, on one site)
Easier to switch between languages (no longer have to find the localized blog URL)
Better platform allows us to maintain content, localize blog post more easily, and format posts consistently 
Going forward, all archived and new blog posts will appear on  https://developers.google.com/search/blog . You don't need to take any action in order to keep getting updates from us; we will redirect the current set of RSS and email subscribers to the new blog URL. 
Googlebot mascot gets a refresh 
Our Googlebot mascot is also getting an upgrade. Googlebot's days of wandering the web solo come to a close as a new sidekick joins Googlebot in crawling the internet. 
When we first met this curious critter, we wondered, ""Is it really a spider?"" After some observation, we noticed this spider bot hybrid can jump great distances and sees best when surrounded by green light. We think Googlebot's new best friend is a spider from the genus  Phidippus , though it seems to also have bot-like characteristics. Googlebot's been trying out new nicknames for the little spider bot, but they haven't settled on anything yet. Maybe you can help? 
As parting words, update your bookmarks and if you have any questions or comments, you can find us on  Twitter  and in our  Google Search Central Help Community .

Timing for bringing page experience to Google Search
Tuesday, November 10, 2020
This past May , we announced that  page experience  signals would be included in Google Search ranking. These signals measure how users perceive the experience of interacting with a web page and contribute to our ongoing work to ensure people get the most helpful and enjoyable experiences from the web. In the past several months, weve seen a median 70% increase in the number of users  engaging with Lighthouse and Page Speed Insights, and many site owners using Search Consoles Core Web Vitals report to identify opportunities for improvement.
Today were announcing that the page experience signals in ranking will roll out in May 2021. The new page experience signals combine Core Web Vitals with our existing search signals including  mobile-friendliness ,  safe-browsing ,  HTTPS-security , and  intrusive interstitial guidelines .
The change for non-AMP content to become eligible to appear in the mobile Top Stories feature in Search will also roll out in May 2021. Any page that meets the  Google News content policies  will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results. 
In addition to the timing updates described above, we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience.
A New Way of Highlighting Great Experiences in Google Search 
We believe that providing information about the quality of a web pages experience can be helpful to users in choosing the search result that they want to visit. On results, the snippet or image preview helps provide topical context for users to know what information a page can provide. Visual indicators on the results are another way to do the same, and we are working on one that identifies pages that have met all of the page experience criteria. We plan to test this soon and if the testing is successful, it will launch in May 2021 and well share more details on the progress of this in the coming months.
The Tools Publishers Need for Improving Page Experience  
To get ready for these changes, we have released a variety of tools that publishers can use to start improving their page experience. The first step is doing a site-wide audit of your pages to see where there is room for improvement. Search Consoles  report  for Core Web Vitals gives you an overview of how your site is doing and a deepdive into issues. Once youve identified opportunities,  Page Speed Insights  and  Lighthouse  can help you as you iterate on fixing any issues that youve uncovered. Head over to  web.dev/vitals-tools  for a roundup of all the tools you need to get started.
Additionally, AMP is  one of the easiest and cost-effective ways  for publishers looking to achieve great page experience outcomes. Based on the  analysis  that the AMP team has done, the majority of the AMP pages achieve great page experiences. If youre an AMP publisher, check out the recently launched  AMP Page Experience Guide , a diagnostic tool that provides developers with actionable advice. 
We continue to support AMP content in Google Search. If you publish an AMP version of your content, Google Search will link to that cache-optimized AMP version to help optimize delivery to users, just as is the case today.
Conclusion 
At Google Search our mission is to help users find the most relevant and quality sites on the web. The goal with these updates is to highlight the best experiences and ensure that users can find the information theyre looking for. Our work is ongoing, which is why we plan to incorporate more page experience signals going forward and update them on a yearly basis. We hope that the  tools and resources  weve provided make it easier for you to create great websites, and thereby build a web ecosystem that users love.

PES@Home 2020: Googles first virtual summit for Product Experts
Thursday, November 05, 2020
More than ever, users are relying on Google products to do their jobs, educate their kids, and stay in touch with loved ones. Our  Google Product Experts  (PEs) play a vital role in supporting these users in community forums, like the  Webmaster Help Community , across many languages.
For several years now, we have been inviting our most advanced PEs from around the world to a bi-annual, 3-day PE Summit. These events provide an opportunity not only to share latest product updates with PEs, but also to acknowledge and celebrate their tireless contributions to help our users. As the world was going into lockdown in March, we quickly decided that we dont want to miss out on this annual celebration. So the summit team shifted focus and started planning an all virtual event which came to be called PES@Home. 
Through the house-themed virtual event platform, PEs participated in over 120 sessions in the ""office"", got a chance to engage with each other and Googlers in the ""kitchen"", had fun on the ""rooftop"" learning more about magic or mixology, and - hopefully - came out feeling reconnected and re-energized. In addition to a large number of general talks, Webmaster PEs were able to attend and ask questions during eight product specific breakout sessions with Search product managers and engineers, which covered topics like page experience, Web Stories, crawling, Image Search, and free shopping listings. 
We are truly overwhelmed and grateful for how Webmaster PEs continue to grow the community, connection, and engagement in such a strange time. As a testament to the helpful spirit in the Webmaster community, we were thrilled to present the ""Silver Lining Award"" for someone who demonstrates a sense of humour and emphasizes the positive side of every situation to one of our own Webmaster PEs.
In the name of all the countless people asking product questions in the forums, we'd like to express our thanks to the patient, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly Webmaster Product Experts, who help to make the web shine when it comes to presence on Search.
If you want to read more about the summit, check out this summary from a  Webmaster PE point of view .

Best practices for Black Friday and Cyber Monday pages
Monday, October 26, 2020
The end of the year holiday season is a peak time for many merchants with special sales events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As a merchant, you can help Google highlight your sales events by providing landing pages with relevant content and high quality images.
Best Practices 
The following are recommended best practices for your landing pages:
Create the page early.  Make sure you create the page well before the sale so Googlebot has time to discover and index the page. Make sure you are not blocking Google from crawling the URL (the Google  URL Inspection Tool  can be used to check this).
Follow standard SEO best practices.  A list of SEO best practices for landing pages can be found in our  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide .
Link to the landing pages from your home page  (or similar) to increase their prominence, helping users (and Google) find the landing page quicker.
Use a recurring URL , not a new URL for each occurrence of the event. Give the landing page of recurring events a meaningful URL that reflects the event that is used each year (for example: use /sale/black-friday, not /sale/2020/black-friday).
Include a relevant, high quality image.  Provide a static image with an up-to-date representation of your sale. Trim any whitespace around the borders of the image, and ensure that the image is visually engaging and is of good quality. For additional guidance on image quality, review the  Google Images best practices  and  Images Web Fundamentals .
Get your page recrawled.  After you've tested your structured data for validity,  ask Google to recrawl your page  to get your content updated more quickly. (Note: as of publication this tool is undergoing maintenance, but we hope to have it up-and-running again soon.) 
If you have any questions, let us know through the  Help forum  or on  Twitter .

The Search Console Training lives on
Friday, October 02, 2020
In November 2019 we announced the  Search Console Training  YouTube series and started publishing videos regularly. The goal of the series was to create updated video content to be used alongside Search documentation, for example in the  Help Center  and in the  Developers site . 
The wonderful Google Developer Studio team (the engine behind those videos!) put together this fun blooper reel for the first wave of videos that we recorded in the Google London studio. 
So far weve published twelve episodes in the series, each focusing on a different part of the tool. Weve seen its helping lots of people to learn how to use Search Console - so  we decided to continue recording videos at home!  Please bear with the trucks, ambulances, neighbors, passing clouds, and of course the doorbell. \_()_/ 
In addition to the location change, were also changing the scope of the new videos. Instead of focusing on one report at a time, well discuss how Search Console can help YOUR business. In each episode well focus on types of website, like ecommerce, and job roles, like developers. 
To hear about new videos as soon as they're published,  subscribe to our YouTube channel , and feel free to leave feedback  on Twitter . 
Stay tuned!

New Schema.org support for retailer shipping data
Tuesday, September 22, 2020
Quick summary : Starting today, we support  shippingDetails  schema.org markup  as an alternative way for retailers to be eligible for shipping details in Google Search results. 
Since June 2020, retailers have been able to list their products across different Google surfaces for free,  including on Google Search . We are committed to supporting ways for the ecosystem to better connect with users that come to Google to look for the best products, brands, and retailers by investing both in more robust tooling in  Google Merchant Center  as well as with new kinds of schema.org options. 
Shipping details, including cost and expected delivery times, are often a key consideration for users making purchase decisions. In our own studies, weve heard that users abandon shopping checkouts because of unforeseen or uncertain shipping costs. This is why we will often show shipping cost information in certain result types, including on free listings on Google Search (currently in the US, in English only). 
Retailers have always been able to  configure shipping settings in Google Merchant Center  in order to display this information in listings. Starting today, we now also support the  shippingDetails  schema.org markup  type for retailers who don't have active Merchant Center accounts with product feeds.
For retailers that are interested in this new markup, check out  our documentation  to get started.

Testimonials 
Mr. Azman (2743) is a valuable asset to BBDC. His enthusiasm for his work is contagious, which made me very engaged and eager to learn more. Thanks to his teaching approach, which involved presenting scenarios I had never encountered before (e.g., driving in the dark), I felt motivated, confident, and well-prepared for the road ahead. Additionally, Mr. Azman fostered a relaxed and enjoyable learning environment, enhancing my overall experience for my DS-DS session today! 
Goh PL, 3A, 10 July 2023 
I would like to give a big thank you to all the instructors in G8011 . Despite being a slow learner, most of them were patient and made sure I understood what was being taught. Through the many practices, their encouragement and guidance, I managed to pass my TP test on my second attempt! Thank you BBDC! 
Lim XY, 3A, 27 July 2023 
I would like to compliment motorcycle instructor Muhd Farhan (6653) . This was my first lesson with him and and it was also my last lesson with him before TP. I was fortunate to have him as my instructor as he shared many tips and guide before my TP. He had also made the lesson fun and interesting with his passion and enthusiasm. 
I really hope he could be recognised and appreciated by the company. Great work Farhan! 
Yue SX, 2, 12 July 2023 
It was such a coincidence to have met Mr Kenneth Chan MS (6447) for my last 2-3 sessions. His comments and coaching has been very helpful. He is very patient in correcting and fine tuning my mistakes. Mr Kenneth take pride in his work and deserves a compliment! Thanks to his fine tuning, I managed to clear my TP test on my first attempt! Was very worried for my vertical parking and those trap test lanes so he really patiently run through with me

Read More Todays Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts and Data    Welcome to CoinMarketCap.com! This site was founded in May 2013 by Brandon Chez to provide up-to-date cryptocurrency prices, charts and data about the emerging cryptocurrency markets. Since then, the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency has grown exponentially and we are very proud to have grown with it. We take our data very seriously and we do not change our data to fit any narrative: we stand for accurately, timely and unbiased information.    All Your Crypto Market Data Needs in One Place    Here at CoinMarketCap, we work very hard to ensure that all the relevant and  up-to-date information  about cryptocurrencies, coins and tokens can be located in one easily discoverable place. From the very first day, the goal was for the site to be the number one location online for crypto market data, and we work hard to empower our users with our unbiased and accurate information.    We Provide Live and Historic Crypto Charts for Free    Each of our coin data pages has a graph that shows both the current and historic price information for the coin or token. Normally, the graph starts at the launch of the asset, but it is possible to select specific to and from dates to customize the chart to your own needs. These charts and their information are free to visitors of our website.    How Do We Calculate Our Cryptocurrency Prices?    We receive updated cryptocurrency prices directly from many exchanges based on their pairs. We then convert the number to USD. A full explanation can be found   here .     Related Links   New to crypto?   Learn how to buy bitcoin today .   Ready to learn more? Visit our   crypto glossary   and  Learning hub .   Want to look up a transaction?   Visit our blockchain explorer.      How Do We Calculate Our Crypto Valuations?    We calculate our valuations based on the total circulating supply of an asset multiplied by the currency reference price. The topic is explained in more detail   here .    How Do We Calculate the Cryptocurrency Market Cap?    We calculate the total cryptocurrency market capitalization as the sum of all cryptocurrencies listed on the site.    Does CoinMarketCap.com List All Cryptocurrencies?    No, we do not list all cryptocurrencies at CoinMarketCap. As a company and team, we are very aware that not all coins and projects have good intentions. While we cannot guarantee to exclude them all, we have a vetting process that each coin goes through before it is listed on the site. If we suspect that a coin or project is a scam, it does not get listed.    How Big Is the Global Coin Market?    At the time of writing, we estimate that there are around 8,000 coins, tokens and projects in the global coin market. As mentioned above, we have a  due diligence process  that we apply to new coins before they are listed. This process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site.     What Is an Altcoin?    The very first cryptocurrency was   Bitcoin . Since it is open source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency. Many people have done exactly this. Some of these coins are very similar to Bitcoin, with just one or two amended features (such as  Litecoin ), while others are very different, with varying models of security, issuance and governance. However, they all share the same moniker  every coin issued after Bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin.     What Is an ICO?    ICO stands for initial coin offering. Many of the smaller projects in the crypto space  and a few of the largest ones  raised money from private investors around the world in the crypto equivalent of a crowdfunding campaign. Investors would send funds  usually in the form of Bitcoin  to the project and receive coin or tokens in return.  Most ICOs happened in 2017 and early 2018 and used  Ethereum  as a platform of operation via the ERC-20 standard. In 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarified their rules relating to fundraising for assets, which made it much harder for new cryptocurrency projects to issue their own tokens in this way. Since the appearance of the SEC guidance and the organizations heightened interest in regulating ICOs for U.S. citizens, the number of ICOs has been reduced substantially.     What Is a Stablecoin?    Price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market. When asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin, it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed. To overcome this problem, a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies  ranging from the U.S. dollar, other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies  arose. These new cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins, and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due to their stability.    What Are In-game Tokens?   Play-to-earn  (P2E) games, also known as  GameFi , has emerged as an extremely popular category in the crypto space. It combines  non-fungible tokens  (NFT), in-game crypto tokens,  decentralized finance  (DeFi) elements and sometimes even metaverse applications. Players have an opportunity to generate revenue by giving their time (and sometimes capital) and playing these games.   One of the biggest winners is  Axie Infinity   a Pokmon-inspired game where players collect Axies (NFTs of digital pets), breed and battle them against other players to earn Smooth Love Potion (SLP)  the in-game reward token. This game was extremely popular in developing countries like The Philippines, due to the decent income they can earn. Players in the Philippines can check the price of  SLP to PHP today  directly on CoinMarketCap.   Which Is the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in?     CoinMarketCap does not offer financial or investment advice about which cryptocurrency, token or asset does or does not make a good investment, nor do we offer advice about the timing of purchases or sales. We are strictly a data company.   Please remember that the prices, yields and values of financial assets change. This means that any capital you may invest is at risk. We recommend seeking the advice of a professional investment advisor for guidance related to your personal circumstances.    If You Are Investing in Cryptocurrency  CoinMarketCap.com Is for You    The data at CoinMarketCap updates throughout the day, which means that it is possible to check in on the value of your investments and assets at any time and from anywhere in the world.
