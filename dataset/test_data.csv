What is a DOI? 
DOI Handbook 
Resources 
The DOI Foundation is a not-for-profit organization. We govern the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system on behalf of the agencies who manage DOI registries and provide services to their respective communities. We are the registration authority for the ISO standard (ISO 26324) for the DOI system and we are governed by our Registration Agencies. 
Read more about us, our operations and our community of communities from construction to entertainment to scholarly research. 
learn more 
WHO IS THE DOI FOUNDATION COMMUNITY? 
We are an international community of communities bound by a common interest in persistent infrastructure. So far, we have welcomed agencies that manage communities spanning entertainment, standards, the built environment, natural history collections, scholarly communications, and research data. 
Read more about our Registration Agencies and what they offer 
learn more 
WHAT IS THE DIGITAL OBJECT IDENTIFIER (DOI)? 
A DOI name is a digital identifier of an object, any object  physical, digital, or abstract. DOIs solve a common problem: keeping track of things. Things can be matter, material, content, or activities. 
Designed to be used by humans as well as machines, DOIs identify objects persistently. They allow things to be uniquely identified and accessed reliably. You know what you have, where it is, and others can track it too. 
Read more about the identifier, its benefits, and how its used 
learn more 
ANNOUNCING OUR NEWEST REGISTRATION AGENCY 
Human & Digital (HAND) was recently appointed as the 12th Registration Agency of the DOI Foundation, assigning DOI names to legal entity humans, licensed virtual humans, and fictional characters involved in the performing arts and sports. The talent industry is becoming more connected, complex, and digitized. Managing this complexity in a programmatic way is only possible with verifiable, persistent identity of talent, both human and digital. And this is exactly what HAND provides. 
Learn more 
How many are being resolved? 
Total DOI resolutions to date (all time) 
The total DOI resolutions to date is calculated using actual number of DOI resolutions recorded up until yesterday and the average resolution rate recorded over the past 24 hours (currently this is  ) 
Uptime over the last 90 days 
Try resolving a DOI name

GNU is the only operating system developed
specifically to give its users freedom.  What is GNU, and what freedom
is at stake? 
Escape to Freedom: A video from the FSF 
What is GNU? 
GNU is an operating system that
is  free software that is,
it respects users' freedom.  The GNU operating system consists of GNU
packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well
as free software released by third parties.  The development of GNU
made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample
your freedom. 
We recommend  installable
versions of GNU  (more precisely, GNU/Linux distributions) which
are entirely free software.   More about GNU
below . 
Try GNU/Linux 
Trisquel10  with  MATE  desktop, and part of the  LibreOffice  suite. 
Dragora / IceWM 
Guix / GNOME3 
Hyperbola / i3 
Parabola / LXDE 
PureOS / GNOME3 
Trisquel / MATE 
... or  
Try parts of GNU 
What is the Free Software Movement? 
The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of
computing the freedom that comes from free software.  Free software
puts its users in control of their own computing.  Nonfree software
puts its users under the power of the software's developer.  See
the video explanation . 
What is Free Software? 
Free software means the users have the freedom to run,
copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. 
Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.  To understand the
concept, you should think of free as in free
speech, not as in free beer. 
More precisely, free software means users of a program have
the  four essential
freedoms : 
The freedom to run the program as you wish,
for any purpose (freedom 0). 
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source
code is a precondition for this. 
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others
(freedom 2). 
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions
to others (freedom 3).  By doing this you can give the whole
community a chance to benefit from your changes.
Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms
even more
important now  than they were in 1983. 
Nowadays the free software movement goes far beyond developing the
GNU system.  See  the Free Software
Foundation's web site  for more about what we do, and a list
of  ways you can help . 
More about GNU 
GNU  is a Unix-like operating system.  That
means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries,
developer tools, even games.  The development of GNU, started in
January 1984, is known as the GNU Project.  Many of the programs in
GNU are released under the auspices of the GNU Project; those we
call  GNU packages . 
The name GNU is a recursive acronym for GNU's
Not
Unix.  GNU
is pronounced  g'noo , as one syllable, like saying
grew but replacing the  r  with  n . 
The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources
and talks to the hardware is called the kernel.  GNU is
typically used with a kernel called Linux.  This combination is
the  GNU/Linux operating
system .  GNU/Linux is used by millions, though
many  call it Linux by
mistake . 
GNU's own kernel, the  GNU Hurd ,
was started in 1990 (before Linux was started).  Volunteers continue
developing the Hurd because it is an interesting technical
project. 
More information 
As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be 
glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we 
should do freely and generously.  Benjamin Franklin 
The GNU Project strongly urges the community to communicate in 
ways that are friendly, welcoming and kind. See the 
GNU Kind Communications Guidelines .

Josh and Chuck have you covered. See All Featured Podcasts The Idaho Massacre On November 13, 2022, four students from the University of Idaho are brutally stabbed to death in an off-campus house. After a lengthy investigation and cross-country manhunt, a Ph.D. student from a neighboring university is charged with the crimes. As it turns out, the 28-year-old was majoring in criminology, studying the behavior of killers like the ones he would later be accused of becoming. Did he use his skills to become a real-life Dexter? Were the Idaho victims his first, or was a serial killer hiding in the midst? The producers of The Piketon Massacre explore all sides of the shocking crime in pursuit of the truth. Dear Alana, Host Simon Kent Fung explores the life of Alana Chen, a 24-year-old woman who disappeared from Boulder, Colorado in 2019. Alana left behind two dozen journals chronicling a deep faith, love of fashion, and dream of becoming a nun. She also harbored a secret. At 14, she confessed to her priest that she was attracted to women and was instructed not to tell her parents. Over the next seven years, Alana covertly received conversion therapy which her family believes played a role in her fate. Simon, who sought to change his sexual orientation through conversion therapy for nearly a decade in his efforts to become a priest, is compelled to understand the truth of what happened to Alanaand finally face what happened to him. ""Dear Alana,"" is an unraveling mystery and a poignant spiritual memoir about teenage rebellion and spiritual manipulation, the price we pay to belong and the systems that pay no price at all.

your first Google Ads account within 14 days of your
first ad impression being served.
The promotional offer will only be applied to your

method is added during the initial signup process.
To earn the Google Ads credit: After the promotional
offer is applied to your Google Ads account, your
advertising campaigns must accrue costs of at least
$600 (excluding any taxes or applicable fees) within
60 days. Making a payment of $600 is not sufficient.
The tracking of advertising costs towards $600

The credit expires 60 days after it is applied to
your account.

Credit cannot be applied to costs accrued before the
promotional offer was applied to your Google Ads
account.
You wont receive a notification once credit in your
Google Ads account is used up and any additional
advertising costs will be charged to your form of
payment. If you dont want to continue advertising,
you can pause or delete your campaigns at any time.
Your account must be successfully billed by Google
Ads and remain in good standing in order to remain
eligible to use the credit.
Google Ads reserves the right to remove the
promotional offer from your account if a payment
fails, an offer was mistakenly applied, you breach
these terms or your account otherwise falls out of
good standing. In such cases, if the promotional
credit has already been granted, Google Ads reserves
the right to nullify that credit.

Singapore-Israel Industrial Research & Development Funding and Grants
Established in 1997, the Singapore-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (SIIRD) is a co-operation between Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) and the Israel Innovation Authority to promote, facilitate and support joint industrial Research and Development (R&D) projects, between companies from Israel and Singapore, which would lead to successful commercialization.
In addition to supporting joint R&D projects, SIIRD will be extending its funding support for pilot projects between Singapore and Israeli companies to pilot or testbed near-market technologies with a specific customer or market segment for the purpose of commercialization.
Types of Research Funding Opportunities
R&D Project Grant
For project with commercialisable product or technology and project duration not more than 2 years. Fund up to 60% of the total qualified project cost or up to US$1.5M, whichever is lower, and up to US$30,000 for commercialisation activities.

Weve been hearing a lot of rumors when it comes to iPhone and Apple Watch accessories recently, as Apple will be holding a special event next week to introduce new products. And while some rumors have claimed that the company will replace the iPhones leather cases with new ones made of a different material, it seems that something similar may happen with Apple Watch leather bands.

Even before Apple unveiled Vision Pro,  Meta already had virtual reality headsets  called Meta Quest (which were created after Meta acquired Oculus). However, Metas headsets arent exactly a hit. But Zuckerberg seems to have ambitious plans to compete with Apple Vision Pro, as a new report suggests that Meta has been working with LG to build a new VR headset.

Im a long-time HomePod mini user. As soon as Apple announced the cheapest version of its smart speaker, I immediately bought a pair to use with my  Apple TV . Then I bought more pairs to spread around my apartment. Even so, I always felt the need to have something with a fuller sound. Now Ive bought a HomePod 2, and its exactly what I wanted  except because theres AirPlay 2.

Report: Apple claims iMessage not big enough to fall under purview of EU gatekeeper competition law 
Benjamin Mayo 
13 hours ago 
26 Comments			 
Via  Financial Times , Apple is claiming that iMessage is not big enough to classify as a gatekeeper service under the definitions of the EUs Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation. The justification for this argument is somewhat unclear, given that iMessage is a preinstalled app on every iPhone sold and is clearly one of the most used apps on the platform. Apple has not commented publicly. 
The first list of gatekeeper services  which will be compelled to follow these tough new DMA regulations  is due to be published this week. Apples App Store is expected to be included, likely paving the way for alternative app stores and third-party iPhone app side-loading.

Review: Beats Studio Proare here, and they make AirPods Max impossible to recommend(for now) 
Chance Miller 
19 hours ago 
39 Comments			 
Update September 4, 2023 : The Beats Studio are already on sale for an  incredible $250 on Amazon (down from their list price of $350).  That makes them even more of a   great deal compared to AirPods Max (via  9to5Toys ).  
The oft-rumored  Beats Studio Pro  headphones are now official. While Apples Beats brand has released a wide and very impressive range of earbuds over the last several years, the new Beats Studio Pro mark the first new Beats headphones since 2019. Theyre also the first new Beats Studio branded headphones since 2017. 
Ive been testing the Beats Studio Pro for the past week, and they stay true to the expectations Beats has set with all of its recent products. That is: They pack a range of impressive features at a lower price than Apples alternatives but with a couple of omissions that could leave Apple users frustrated. 
That being said: The features offered by Beats Studio Pro and not offered by AirPods Max make Apples over-ear headphones virtually impossible to recommend for now. Oh, and the Beats Studio Pro are $200 cheaper and include a 3.5mm headphone cable in the box.

In the latest edition of  Bloombergs Power On Newsletter , Mark Gurman reveals more tidbits about what he is hearing for the upcoming 2024 iPad Pro redesign. Specifically, the  new Magic Keyboard  will be significantly redesigned, using aluminum materials for the first time.  
This will make it more like a laptop than ever, as  referenced in a Bloomberg report  published last week. The new Magic Keyboard case will also feature a larger surface area trackpad, for easier cursor movements on the iPad.

I am writing on behalf of my mum, Mdm Lee, who has breathing difficulty.
She would like to express her thanks to Ms Rose for changing the rectangle incense burner to the drum burner  and Ms Jessie for removing the extra burner.
Both staff attended to her feedback immediately as the incense burner causes smoke and ashes to enter into her unit causing breathing problems.
We really appreciate your staff understanding and swift response in attending to this matter.

I wish to express my gratitude to Ms Jessie, Mr Chan and Mr Samy for helping me to settle the choked sink at my dads house.
I tried to called many plumbers, but no one could come down till the next working day. I called the town council and Ms Jessie attended my call. She told me she will sent someone within 2 hours.
Within 20 minutes, Mr Samy came to fix the plumbing. Mr Chan also called to check up if anyone has turned up.
I really appreciated the town council and their staff for the support rendered to me. Once again thank you very much.

I would like to extend my compliments to Faizal, Hafiz and Saadon from the service crew. I gave a call to EMSU hotline about a leak in the pipe outside my house and they came down to take a look.
Although fixing of the leak does not come under their purview of the PUB pipe, they were kind enough to fix it. They also advised us on the usage of the pipe, and ensured our water supply was not interrupted before they left.
I was overall impressed with their sense of professionalism especially when they went the extra mile

Many thanks to you and your team for all the recent upgrading works (paint works/pavements works/staircase works/tiling works) around this area of Blks 10 ~ 13 Holland Ave/Drive. The pavement and stair upgrades are going to be really helpful for the elder people staying around here on rainy days. Really appreciate it as a resident in Buona Vista.

vJoy 
This project was originally designed to provide an open-source replacement for PPJoy. The product, at this point, consists of virtual joystick devices that is seen by the system as a standard joystick but its position-data is written to it by a feeder application. An existing feeder application that takes advantage of this product is SmartPropoPlus. If you are an application writer you can very easily write an application that controls a joystick (e.g. mouse-to-joystick, keyboard-to-joystick). If you are a beginner in device drivers you can take this code and enhance it to support more (or less) axes, buttons or POVs.

From today's featured article 
Kaske c. 1974 
Robert Kaske  (19211989) was an American professor of  medieval literature  who founded the  medieval studies  program at  Cornell University  in  Ithaca, New York . He published lengthy interpretations of  Beowulf  and of poems and passages by  Dante  and  Chaucer . Kaske particularly enjoyed solving difficult, puzzling passages in works such as  Pearl ,  Piers Plowman , the  Divine Comedy ,  The Husband's Message  and  The Descent into Hell . In 1975 he was appointed chief editor of the journal  Traditio . Over the course of his career he collected what one former student termed ""most of the awards and honors possible for a medieval scholar"", including fellowships from the  National Endowment for the Humanities  and the  American Council of Learned Societies , and two  Guggenheim Fellowships . In 1988 Kaske published  Medieval Christian Literary Imagery: A Guide to Interpretation , which colleagues called a ""magisterial work"". ( Fullarticle... )

$1:  George Washington 
$5:  Abraham Lincoln 
Silver certificates  are a type of  representative money  issued between 1878 and 1964 in the United States as part of its circulation of paper currency. They were produced in response to  silver agitation  by citizens who were angered by the  Coinage Act of 1873 , which had effectively placed the United States on a  gold standard . Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in  Federal Reserve Notes  and are thus obsolete, but they remain  legal tender  at their face value and hence are still an accepted form of currency. This is a complete set of the 1923 series of large-size silver certificates, designed by the  Bureau of Engraving and Printing  and comprising two denominations,  one dollar  and  five dollars . On the  obverse , each banknote bears the portrait of a US president ( George Washington  and  Abraham Lincoln ) and the engraved signatures of a  register of the Treasury  ( W.O. Woods  and H.V. Speelman) and a  treasurer of the United States  ( H.T. Tate  and  Frank White ).

"Hacked by $GRoo7 
Hacked by $GRoo7 
Tuan dan puan DPR kami suara bising selalu terlintang
dan terdengar nyaring di telingamu
apakah tuan tidak merasa tuli mendengarnya?
Perlakuanmu membuat kami terdiksriminasi dan tertantang atas kebijakan yang kalian buat
tanpa mengikuti asas yang ada yaitu Demokrasi
Tanpa kalian sadari bahkan kalian sadari bahwa kita di ciptakan dari unsur yang sama
Tuan dan puan DPR kami, engkau hanya berlabelkan wujud Manusia
Tapi fikiranmu layaknya seperti hewan peliharaan
Jika Kalian hanya melihat kami di kursi emasmu
Maka engkau adalah orang yang tak waras dan pantas untuk di kasihani
